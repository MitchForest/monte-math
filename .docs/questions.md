## Grade K — Counting And Cardinality (CC)

### Cluster `A` — Know Number Names And The Count Sequence (*Major*)

#### `K.CC.A.1` Task

#
K.CC Choral Counting

##
Task

The teacher will need a 100 chart or large number line and a pointer.

As a whole group, have students chant the counting sequence starting with one to thirty, using the pointer to follow the number sequence. Over time, increase the range to one to fifty and then one to one hundred. Eventually have a student take over the job of pointing out the numbers in the sequence. Highlight the multiples of ten using a marker or a colored screen and have students chant the counting sequence by 10s. This should be done daily.

##
Solution

Start the counting sequence with one to thirty, then over time increasing to one to fifty and then one to one hundred.

Count by tens: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.

#### `K.CC.A.2` Task

#
K.CC Start-Stop Counting

##
Task

Have students form a circle and sit facing in toward each other. The teacher selects a range of the number sequence to practice. Start with the teacher walking around the outside of the circle while counting aloud starting at the beginning of the selected counting sequence.

After a few moments the teacher taps a student on the head and sits in the student's spot. The student then gets up from the circle and continues the counting at the point that the teacher left off while walking around the outside of the circle.

At the teacher’s signal the student who is counting selects the nearest student to them by tapping them on the head to take over counting and sits in that student’s spot. The next child then continues the counting sequence until the teacher indicates a change and so on until each child has had a turn. If the class reaches the end of the counting sequence before each child has participated simply start the sequence over again.

This is similar to Duck, Duck, Goose but without the chasing to get to a spot.

##
Solution

Any counting sequence can be selected depending on student abilities. In a kindergarten class 1-20 or 30 might be a starting point but this can easily be extended to 1-100 going forward and 50-1 going backward.

#### `K.CC.A.3` Task

#
K.CC Bags of Stuff

##
Task

Materials

- 10-15 quart plastic bags of various counters (different numbers of counters in each bag)

- A recording sheet for the activity with pictures of counters and lines for recording the total number of objects

- A teacher completed recording sheet with the correct numbers written for each item

Action

The students choose a bag they have not counted. They are given the directions to count the items in the bag and record the number on the line next to the picture of the item in the bag. The students will then check their answers against the teacher-prepared recording sheet. If the activity is done in committee, the teacher should ask each student, “How many (triangles) were in the bag?” If the activity is done daily, the teacher should ask four or five different students, “How many (triangles) were in the bag?” The process is repeated until time runs out or all bags of stuff have been counted.

##
Solution

-

The students count and record numbers 1-20.

-

The students become familiar with the number names 1-20.

-

The students check their answers against the teacher-prepared sheet.

-

The students answer the question as to how many items were in a bag.


### Cluster `B` — Count To Tell The Number Of Objects (*Major*)

#### `K.CC.B.4` Task

#
K.CC Goody Bags

##
Task

Materials

-

Many small ziplock bags of counting objects (the “goodies”). Each bag should contain a number of objects in the counting sequence students are working on, between 1 and 20.

-

Post-it notes and pencils.

Actions

Students count the objects, record the number on the post-it note and stick the post-it note onto the outside of the bag.

Students can work in pairs to scaffold their counting, and teachers should take care that at least one student in each pair is a confident counter and at least one student is a confident writer. Students can be provided with a number line to aid in writing the numbers. If the teacher is concerned that students cannot write the numbers independently s/he can write the quantities on post-it notes ahead of time and let the students choose the post it note that goes with each goody bag.

#### `K.CC.B.5` Task

#
K.CC Finding Equal Groups

##
Task

Material

- Assorted objects to create the groups

- Clear ziplock bags or small cups

- Index cards and stickers

- An egg timer or a kitchen timer

Action

The teacher will assemble a variety of groups of objects in a few different forms. For example the teacher might put together:

- an index card with 5 stickers

- a clear ziplock bag with 7 beans

- a cup filled with 4 pennies

- an index card with a 4 smiley faces drawn onto it

- a clear ziplock bag with 4 unifix cubes inside

- 5 crayons held together by a rubber band

- a picture of 7 fingers

- 5 small toy animals in a clear ziplock bag

- 7 erasers in a small cup

- a group of 4 pencils held together by a rubber band

The teacher will give students a timer, and the students will race against the clock to sort the groups of objects into three separate groups (grouped by quantity) by the time the timer is finished. This can be played individually or in pairs.

##
Solution

Students will have the sets of objects and cards grouped according to the same number of objects/pictures.


### Cluster `C` — Compare Numbers (*Major*)

#### `K.CC.C.6` Task

#
K.CC Which number is greater? Which number is less? How do you know?

##
Task

Action:

This task should be done as a whole group. * The teacher will show the class two groups of objects or drawings of objects.* The class will chorally count the two groups and the teacher or a student can record the number below the group. * The teacher will then ask the class to chorally say which number is greater and which number is less. * The teacher will then instruct students to turn to their talking partner and tell them how they know which number is greater or less than the other number. It can be helpful if students have preassigned "talking partners." This is not necessary, but will make the lesson go more smoothly as students will quickly know who they should turn and talk with.

##
Solution

“When I count it goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, *6*, 7, 8, than *9*. I know that six is less than nine because I say six before I say nine.”

“I know that nine is greater than six because my brother is nine years old and I'm six years old, and he’s older than me.”

“Okay, you have six. One more is seven. One more is eight. One more is nine. So nine is greater than six. Okay?”

“Well, when I see the number line I see six comes before nine.” “

This many fingers is six (shows six fingers). This many fingers is nine (shows nine fingers). I have to put up more to show you nine.”

Any answer which includes the child correctly explaining why one number is greater or less than the other is acceptable. The teacher should encourage students to use the words greater than/less than. The first few times this activity is done the answers may be long and full of extra information that is not relevant to the problem such as, “You know my brother Jayovanni. He’s in third grade. He used to be in kindergarten with you Mrs. Wood. He loved kindergarten! Well now he’s in Ms. Martin’s class. My mama got him new blue Jordans, but I didn't get new ones because my feet are still the same size as when I got these shoes. Well Jayovonni is nine. And I’m five. Five is less then six. Jayovonni is older then me. I know that nine is more then six because Jayovonni is nine and he is older then me.” If this happens the teacher should paraphrase the relevant math information back to the student.

The answer of “nine is bigger than six” is not a sufficient answer. The students need to explain why they know nine is greater than six, or six is less than nine. If students use the words bigger/smaller, the teacher should help the students connect this language to the more precise words (greater than/less than) and help the students use this language.

#### `K.CC.C.7` Task

#
K.CC Guess the Marbles in the Bag

##
Task

This activity can be done as an entire class or in small groups.

Materials

Paper bags and marbles (or some other counter, as long as it is relatively noisy).

Actions

(Whole-class version) The teacher secretly places between 1 and 10 marbles in a paper bag, then shows the bag to the class. After shaking it enough times for students to hear the marbles inside, and 4 or 5 students guess how many marbles are in the bag. The teacher writes the guesses on the board. Afterwards the contents of the bag are revealed and counted out. The teacher writes the number representing the total on the board, and the students then help sort their guesses into less than, greater than, or equal to the number of marbles in the bag. The game repeats until everyone has had a chance to guess at least once.

(Small group version) This works like the class version but one student in a group fill the bag with marbles themselves and the rest of the group tries to guess the number. With this variation it is practical to allow the students to both hear and feel the marbles inside the bag before they make their guess.



## Grade K — Geometry (G)

### Cluster `A` — Identify And Describe Shapes (Squares, Circles, Triangles, Rectangles, Hexagons, Cubes, Cones, Cylinders, And Spheres) (*Additional*)

#### `K.G.A.2` Task

#
Recognizing Squares

##
Task

Instruct student to draw a ring around three squares.

##
Solution

Correct if student selects all and only the three squares.

In the picture below, the three squares have arrows pointing to them. The three shapes that are not squares have red, dashed outlines.


### Cluster `B` — Analyze, Compare, Create, And Compose Shapes (*Supporting*)

#### `K.G.B.4` Task

#
K.G Alike or Different Game

##
Task

###
Materials:

This game uses the 16 cards below.

###
Actions:

Students in pairs take turns drawing two cards. They should name something that is the ALIKE or DIFFERENT between the two cards. Then the next two cards are drawn and the process repeats until no cards remain.

In a cooperative game, the students work together to name a property for each pair.

In a competitive game, the student who can name a property first gets to keep the cards and the student with the most cards at the end of the game wins. Since the properties may depend on the orientation of the cards, students should sit side-by-side in this version.

##
Attached Resources

- Black line master (png)

##
Solution

ALIKE: “They both have four sides.”

DIFFERENT: “Only one is round.”

DIFFERENT: “There are fewer sides on the triangle.”

ALIKE: “They are narrower at the top.”

(This depends on the orientation when students place the cards down.)

There are many possible solutions for this game. Each solution a child produces should be evaluated based on their reasoning, such as "these are the alike because..." or "these are different because....".



## Grade K — Measurement And Data (MD)

### Cluster `A` — Describe And Compare Measurable Attributes (*Additional*)

#### `K.MD.A.2` Task

#
K.MD Size Shuffle

##
Task

Materials

- One pair of "taller" and "shorter" cards for each student

Action

-

The students stand in a circle with the cards in their hands.

-

The teacher says "GO." The students find a partner and stand face-to-face. The taller student holds up the "taller" card and the shorter student holds up the "shorter" card.

-

When the teacher calls out a student’s name, they respond in a complete sentence:

I am shorter (taller) than __________.The teacher calls on three or four students each round.

The teacher says "GO" and calls on three or four different students each time until all the students have had a turn to respond.

##
Solution

Students should become familiar with the words, “taller/shorter”, and that they refer to height.

Other possible variations are; having each student hold a number of items, different sizes of items or containers. The responses would then be: more/less, bigger/littler, hold more/hold less, or heavier/lighter.


### Cluster `B` — Classify Objects And Count The Number Of Objects In Each Category (*Supporting*)

#### `K.MD.B.3` Task

#
K.MD Goodie Bags

##
Task

Compare 3 quantities and order them from least to greatest.

Materials

- 5-6 baggies of various items. Each baggie should contain one type of item in three different sizes, colors, or shapes. For example, a bag that contains 5 red buttons, 6 blue buttons, and 7 green buttons.

- 3 small bowls, or a piece of construction paper cut into thirds

Setup

This activity is done in partners who can help support each other. Each pair of students should be in a small group of 6 or 8 so all students can share baggies.

Action

Together, the partners sort the contents of one of the baggies. After the sorting is finished, the partners count each group of items. They then arrange each group in order from least to most.

After the items have been arranged, they are put back into the baggie and the students get another baggie and repeat the process.

##
Solution

The students sort the objects into categories.

The students count the number in each category.

The students order the groups of objects from least to most.

The students practice using the words “least” and “most”.



## Grade K — Number And Operations In Base Ten (NBT)

### Cluster `A` — Work With Numbers 11–19 To Gain Foundations For Place Value (*Major*)

#### `K.NBT.A.1` Task

#
K.NBT What Makes a Teen Number?

##
Task

Decompose teen numbers using 10-frames and a number equation.

Materials

- Number cards 11-19

- Pencil, crayon, or marker

- Attached student worksheet

Action

This activity can be done individually, in partners, or in small groups. The students have a teacher-made sheet and a writing implement. The cards are shuffled and placed face down.

The student picks a card off of the top of the pile. The student then says the number and draws that many dots beginning with the first 10-frame. When the first 10-frame is filled, the student continues drawing the remaining dots in the next 10-frame. The student then fills in the blank equation with the corresponding numbers.

Example:

The student continues to pick cards and illustrate numbers in this way until all cards are used or the sheet is filled.

##
Attached Resources

- student worksheet/blackline master

##
Solution

Here is the solution for number 13:

The solutions for 11-19 follow the same pattern.



## Grade K — Operations And Algebraic Thinking (OA)

### Cluster `A` — Understand Addition As Putting Together And Adding To, And Under- Stand Subtraction As Taking Apart And Taking From (*Major*)

#### `K.OA.A.1` Task

#
K.OA Dice Addition 2

##
Task

Adding two numbers to make an equation.

Materials

- One pair of dice per student

- A recording sheet for the activity. For example:

Action

The students roll the dice. They record the numbers on the dice, one as the first addend and the other as the second addend in the equation, with numerals or dot pattern from the dice. They count all the dots and record the total in the equation.

##
Solution

The students practice adding and writing equations for sums of numbers between 1 and 6.

#### `K.OA.A.2` Task

#
K.CC,OA Dice Addition 1

##
Task

Materials

Each pair of students needs: * One worksheet * Two markers of different colors * One pair of dice

Action

Student A rolls the two dice, finds the sum, and traces the number on the worksheet which corresponds to the answer with his/her marker. Student A then passes the dice to Student B who rolls both the dice, finds the sum and traces the correct number on the worksheet with his/her marker. Play continues this way until one of the numbers “wins” (i.e. all of the numbers of that quantity have been traced).

##
Solution

There is no one solution for this task. Students have correctly solved the task when they have taken turns, counted the dots on their dice and recorded the sum until one number is the "winner."

#### `K.OA.A.3` Task

#
K.OA My Book of Five

##
Task

Materials

* Double sided counters* Markers that are the same colors as the counters * Teacher-made “My Book of 5” (see below for detailed directions)

Action

Students will be given double sided counters/dots (see picture of counters, above). It is important for the markers to match the colors on the counters. Students take five counters in their cupped hands (or a cup), shake them around, pour them onto the desk. Next, they count how many counters are yellow and how many are red. Students then record the numbers in their book and write a corresponding equation. For example, if the counters landed so that 1 was yellow and 4 were red, then the student would draw one yellow dot and four red dots and then write “1+4=5” under the drawing. The student would then collect the counters and roll them again. For each combination of colors, the students record with a picture and an equation. Students continue until they fill their book of 5. The teacher can choose how many pages to put in, somewhere between five and eight is a good number so that students get a chance to see multiple combinations. After the students have completed their books, the teacher should have a whole-group discussion to make the number relationships explicit. One way to do this is to write each of the two addends into a table and to discuss possible patterns and reasons for the pattern. The teacher can ask specific questions such as, “What do you notice about the numbers in the table?” Or “Why is it that as one number gets bigger, the other number gets smaller?”Once students have completed the book, the activity can be repeated but with a book that has 6 pages. The students would then need to create one page for each possible way to make five. How to make "My Book of 5": The book could simply be blank pages stapled together and the student creates the circle and writes the equation under. If your students need more scaffolding each page of the book can consist of five empty circles which the students color in. This will make it impossible for the students to accidentally draw four or six circles. See below for an example: Empty Book Pages:Filled In by Student:Here is a photo of students working on different numbered books (not books of five):

##
Solution

$$ \begin{align} 0 + 5 &= 5 \\ 1 + 4 &= 5 \\ 2 + 3 &= 5 \\ 3 + 2 &= 5 \\ 4 + 1 &= 5 \\ 5 + 0 &= 5 \end{align} $$

#### `K.OA.A.5` Task

#
K.OA Many Ways to Do Addition 1

##
Task

Materials

- Class white board and one marker

- Paper and pencil for students

- Materials such as counters or linker cubes

- Number lines that go from 0 to 10

Actions

-

The teacher writes a simple addition problem on the white board. This should be a problem that is within easy grasp of all students, such as 3+2.

-

Students then solve the problem using whichever strategy they choose. Then the teacher and the class should establish that the answer is 5. The focus of this lesson isn’t the solution 3+2 = 5 but rather making explicit to students all the ways they can go about solving such a problem. However, young learners love to have the “answer” to things and students won’t be able to focus on the next part of the problem until they know the teacher knows that they know the answer.

-

The teacher should then have students brainstorm all the ways they can solve an addition problem like 3+2. Students should be encouraged to imagine a different strategy than the one they used. Students should talk with a partner first so everyone can have a chance to participate.

-

Once students have been given about 90 seconds to talk, the teacher should bring the class back together. The teacher can use a random calling method such as sticks with students’ names or can take raised hands. Random calling will ensure that many students get a chance to talk. The teacher will compile a list on the board of all the ways students have come up with.

This list should include:

- draw a picture of the problem

- using fingers to count

- using a number line

- counting on

- using counters

- knowing a subtraction fact and using that information (such as 5-2= 3, therefore I know that 2+3=5)

- using knowledge of all the ways to make five, such as 0+5, 1+4, 2+3

To get variety, the teacher can ask, "Did anyone do it another way?" Students may come up with ways other than those described here; the teacher should include all reasonable responses in the list. The teacher may need to provide a few of the higher level ideas, such as using a subtraction fact or counting on.

Once students have brainstormed ideas, the teacher should give them another chance to talk. The teacher can use the give one/get one procedure. Students stand up and find a friend to talk to. They give the friend one addition strategy and then get one additional strategy.

##
Solution

- sketching out the problem

- using fingers to count

- using a number line

- counting on

- using counters

- knowing a subtraction fact and using that information (such as 5-2= 3, therefore I know that 2+3=5)

- using knowledge of all the ways to make five, such as 0+5, 1+4, 2+3



## Grade 1 — Geometry (G)

### Cluster `A` — Reason With Shapes And Their Attributes (*Additional*)

#### `1.G.A.1` Task

#
1.G 3-D Shape Sort

##
Task

As a whole group, students will sort a collection of three-dimensional objects into categories by shape. There should be several that fall into each of the categories below:

-

sphere

-

cone

-

pyramid

-

cube

-

cylinder

-

rectangular prism

As a class, students brainstorm attributes of the objects they have classified, and the teacher writes those attributes where the entire class can see them. Students then use one of the following sentence frames as they classify the objects. The sentence frames should be written on sentence strips or some other large paper so that the entire class can read/see them during the activity.)

The ___________ is in the shape of a __________ . It is/has __________ , just like all ____________.

The ___________ is in the shape of a __________ . It is/has ___________ , but some ___________ aren't/don't.

The teacher models with one or two objects to start. An example would be:

"The can is in the shape of a cylinder. It has circles on the ends, just like all cylinders."

"The can is a in the shape of a cylinder. It is made of metal, but some cylinders aren't."

This will help students distinguish between defining attributes and non-defining attributes.

Once students are familiar with this task they can be given a set of cards and can work in pairs to classify by defining attribute using the (now familiar) sentence frames.

##
Solution

The attributes that students describe will vary, but here are some examples (in adult language):

-

The baseball is in the shape of a sphere. It is round, just like all spheres.

-

The orange is in the shape of a sphere. It is orange, but some spheres aren't.

-

The food can is in the shape of a cylinder. The label is a rectangle when we take it off and lay it flat, just like all cylinders (if we could remove the surface).

-

The toilet paper roll is in the shape of a cylinder. It is made of paper, but some cylinders aren't.

-

The box of markers is in the shape of a rectangular prism. The corners are square, just like all rectangular prisms.

-

The brick is in the shape of a rectangular prism. It is heavy, but some rectangular prisms aren't.

-

The Egyptian pyramids are in the shape of a pyramid. They come to a point at the top, just like all pyramids.

-

The food pyramid is not in the shape of a pyramid. It is flat, which is why it isn't a real pyramid.

## Grade 1 — Measurement And Data (MD)

### Cluster `A` — Measure Lengths Indirectly And By Iterating Length Units (*Major*)

#### `1.MD.A.2` Task

#
1.MD Measure Me!

##
Task

Materials

* Student worksheet * Unifix cubes * Pencils * Clip boards (optional)

Actions

Students will work on the rug in pairs and measure each other. Student A starts with a worksheet:and writes their name on top. Then they write their partner’s name in the speech bubble where it says “I am_______”. Student A measures Student B using the unifix cubes and records the length of Student B’s arm, leg, foot, hand and neck in the corresponding boxes. Students should connect the unifix cubes to make a measuring stick from them as opposed to lining individual cubes up next to their partner. Once Student A finishes, the partners switch and, using a second worksheet (or the reverse side if the teacher copies the worksheets so that they are double sided), Student B now measures Student A and records the values. Once they are finished, the students return to the whole group where the teacher can ask,

Who has the longest leg, you or your partner?

The students should then stand side-by-side to verify that their measurements correctly identified the longest leg. If they don't, then students should re-measure their legs. It is easy for students to lose track while counting or to measure imprecisely. This would be a good opportunity for teachers to talk about how it is important to measure carefully in order to get accurate measurements. Students who finish early can measure other objects in the classroom.

#### `1.MD.C.4` Task

#
1.MD Weather Graph Data

##
Task

Materials

- Completed monthly weather recording sheet

- Crayons

- Sentence strips with frames (see below)

- Student worksheet

Actions

- Every day for a month the students record the weather by shading in an appropriate box on the recording sheet (attached).

- At the completion of a month of school, the teacher projects the completed recording sheet using a document projector (if working with the whole class) or shows it to the students (if working in a small group setting).

- The teacher asks the students to count how many days in the month each type of weather occurred, writing the number by the type of weather.

-

The teacher or another student asks questions like these:

- How many rainy days did we have this month?

- How many more rainy days did we have than sunny days?

- How many days did we record the weather?

Students compose answers to the questions using sentence frames like these:

- In September there were ___ ______ days

- There were ___ more ________ days than ________ days

- There were ___ fewer _________ days than _______ days

- We recorded ____ days of weather altogether.

Both numbers and types of weather are used to fill in the blanks. Students pair up and share an idea for each sentence frame; then the teacher chooses a student to fill in one of the frames orally, while it is recorded onto the sentence frame.

- The students copy the data from the recording sheet onto their worksheet to create their own graph. The teacher may need to model this for the students the first time they do it.

- The students choose a sentence based on the completed frames to match each of the weather pictures given. So, for the sunny picture a student could write, "There were 5 more sunny days than rainy days," or "There were 12 sunny days in September." The frame of "We recorded ___ days of weather altogether" could be stated orally, or added at the bottom of the recording sheet to be filled in. The teacher may need to model this for the students the first time they do it.

## Grade 1 — Number And Operations In Base Ten (NBT)

### Cluster `A` — Extend The Counting Sequence (*Major*)

#### `1.NBT.A.1` Task

#
1.NBT Choral Counting II

##
Task

###
Materials

- 100 chart or large number line, preferably one that extends beyond 100.

- A pointer

###
Setup

Have students sit in the whole group meeting area.

###
Actions

Lead the students in chanting the counting sequence starting with one to one hundred; use the pointer to follow the number sequence. Then start counting at various numbers other than one that are randomly selected from 1-120. Have a student take over the job of pointing out the number sequence. Highlight the multiples of ten using a marker or a colored screen and have students chant the counting sequence by 10s, by 5s and by 2s. This should be done daily.

##
Solution

Start the counting sequence with one to one hundred, then begin picking starting numbers other than one.This will help students build the flexibility to start a count from a number other than one.

Select a number from 1-50 and count backward by ones; once students are fluent, move to numbers from 50-100 as starting points.

Count by decuple numbers — 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100, by 5s to 50 and by 2s to 20.


### Cluster `B` — Understand Place Value (*Major*)

#### `1.NBT.B.2` Task

#
1.NBT Roll & Build

##
Task

Materials

For each pair:

-

2 ten-sided dice with the numbers 0 to 9 or two spinners with the numbers 0 to 9

-

Base-10 blocks, linking cubes, or bundled and loose popsicle sticks

-

Paper and pencil

Play

-

Student A rolls the dice.

-

Student B makes a number using the values on the dice as digits and both students write it on the paper. For example, if student A rolled a 3 and a 4, the number can be 34 or 43.

-

Student A represents the number with the tens and ones blocks/popsicle sticks.

-

Student B counts the blocks to check that they correctly represent the number.

-

Both students draw a picture of the tens and ones on the paper.

The students should take turns.

##
Solution

If the student rolls a 3 and a 4, they could write 43 and select 4 tens and 3 ones:

1.NBT Comparing Numbers

##
Task

Materials

- A spinner with the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... 9

- A spinner with the decades 00, 10, 20, ... 90

- Math journal or teacher-made worksheet

- Pencil

Actions

- Partner #1 spins the decade spinner and writes the number in the tens place.

- Partner #1 spins the 0-9 spinner and writes the number in the ones place to make a two-digit number.

- Partner #2 repeats steps 1 and 2 to make another two-digit number and writes it in their math journal or on the worksheet.

- Partners decided together whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

- Partners write the corresponding symbol ($\lt$, $\gt$, =) between the two numbers.

- Partners repeat until the teacher ends the game.

##
Solution

The outcome depends on where the spinner lands, but there should be a list of comparisons between two 2-digit numbers like this:

$47 \gt 32$

#### `1.NBT.C.4` Task

#
Addition within 100

##
Task

##
Solution

Correct if student writes the number 82.

The best way to find the sum is to take advantage of place value, adding ones to ones and tens to tens.

There are several ways this can be done. Some first graders might use the standard algorithm to organize their work:

Many students will first combine the tens (50 + 20 = 70), next combine the ones (6 + 6 = 12), and finally add these results to obtain the final answer: 70 + 12 = 82. This approach is fine in grade 1. As problems get more complicated, students will learn increasingly efficient procedures culminating in the standard algorithms.

Some students may draw pictures of tens and ones to help them find the sum. In the diagram to the right, a long line represents a ten and a dot represents a one. The top part of the picture shows 56, and the part beneath that shows 26. Effectively, the diagram explains why the numerical procedures give the right answer. Students should be able to show what is going on; diagrams like these will be useful in second grade when students learn to add and subtract three-digit numbers. However, in second grade students will be expected to find sums like 56 + 26 fluently, working with the number symbols themselves rather than using diagrams or objects for support.

Finally, some students might try using mental arithmetic. For example, they could use a compensation approach: consider that if we were to increase 26 by four, and decrease 56 by four, then we would have an equivalent but easier problem: 52 + 30 = 82. This approach shows good number sense—it is the kind of thinking that will be valuable later on in algebra. However, compensation and other opportunistic approaches don’t generalize well to calculations like 8753 – 2476, which is why students need to learn systematic methods based on place value. And for most first graders, trying to add 56 + 26 mentally will likely result in a wrong answer because of a mistake along the way.

1.OA At the Park

##
Task

- There were 7 children at the park. Then 4 more showed up. How many children were at the park all together?

- There were 7 children at the park. Some more showed up. Then there were 11 children in all. How many more children came?

- There were some children at the park. Four more children showed up. Then there were 11 children at the park. How many children were at the park to start with?

##
Solution

Students may use objects, pictures, or equations to represent their solutions. The solutions show equations with a question mark representing the unknown value, but other symbols are often used. For example, 4 + ? = 11 might also be written

4 + ____ = 11 or 4 + ☐ = 11.

- Total Unknown: There were $11$ children in all.

Possible equation: $7 + 4 =$ ?

- Addend Unknown: $4$ more children came.

Possible equation: $7 +$ ? $= 11$

- Start Unknown: There were $7$ children in the park to start with.

Possible equation: ? $+ 4 = 11$

1.OA Daisies in vases

##
Task

Jasmine has eight daisies and three vases - one large, one medium-sized and one small.

She puts 5 daisies in the large vase, 2 in the medium vase and 1 in the small vase.

- Can you find another way to put daisies so that there are the most in the large vase and least in the small vase?

- Try to find as many ways as you can put the daisies in the vases with the most in the large vase and the least in the smallest vase. If you think you have found them all, explain how you know those are all the possibilities.

##
Solution

The full list is:

- $8$ in the large, and none in the others, which we abbreviate as $8,0,0$.

- $7$ in large, $1$ in medium, $0$ in small, which we abbreviate as $7,1,0$.

- $6, 2, 0$

- $6, 1, 1$

- $5, 3, 0$

- $5,2,1$

- $4, 4, 0$

- $4, 3, 1$

- $4, 2, 2$

- $3, 3, 2$

If students and the teacher decide to not allow empty vases or equal numbers, there are only two possibilities, the other being $4,3,1$. It is likely that at least equal amounts will be allowed, in which case there are five possibilities.

One full solution strategy is to first decide how many are in the first vase, and then decide from there how many in the second and third vases.

1.OA Domino Addition

##
Task

Materials

- A large set of dominoes to affix to a whiteboard or place in a pocket chart, or a regular set to use on a document projector.

- One set of dominoes for each student or pair of students

- Domino addition worksheets

Actions

- The teacher asks a child to choose a domino from a stack or bag. As the teacher holds up the domino, the students call out how many dots are on the domino altogether.

- Next the class counts the number of dots on each end of the domino to check their responses. Then the class names an addition equation that represents the relation between total number of dots and the number of dots on each end. For example, if the domino has 4 dots on one side and 2 dots on the other, the teacher can show the domino with the 4 on the left and the 2 on the right and the class names the equation 4+2=6. The teacher then writes the equation.

- Then the teacher rotates the domino so the 2 is on the left and the 4 is on the right, and the class can name the equation 2+4=6. The teacher then writes the equation. The teacher then draws the dots from the chosen domino on a blank domino.

- Once the students understand the task, they can work on their own. Students should have a set of dominoes to explore individually or with a partner, along with the domino addition worksheet. There are two variants of this task.

- Students can choose dominoes at random, draw the dot pattern, and write the two related equations.

- Students can find all of the dominoes that have a particular sum, and then draw all the related dot patterns and equations. For example, they could look for all the dominoes that have 6 dots all together, then draw the dot patterns for those dominoes and write the corresponding equations.

1.OA Cave Game Subtraction

##
Task

Materials

- A cup for each student to represent his/her cave

- Counters

- Recording sheet

Actions

The teacher begins by counting out a certain number of counters to find the total number of counters in the whole collection. For example,One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine, ten. There are ten counters all together.

This number should be small enough that the students have already found sums equal to that number, for example, 10. The teacher then hides some in the cup, calling it a cave. The students are shown how many counters are remaining outside of the cup, but not how many are in the cup. The number outside of the cup is called the part that they know.

Next, the teacher shows the students an equation like this

10 - ___ = 6

if the teacher is hiding 4 counters. The students need to find the missing number. By adding, or counting on to 6, the students determine that the teacher is hiding 4 counters. The equation is completed, and checked for accuracy by seeing how many counters are hidden under the cup.

The students are then asked to help the teacher find another way to play the game with the same total number and a different part that they know. The goal is to find all the subtraction equations for the total they started with. When the teacher determines that the students understand the procedures of the game, they may play independently or in partners.

1.OA, NBT The Very Hungry Caterpillar

##
Task

Materials

- The Very Hungry Caterpillarby Eric Carle

The students work individually or in pairs. Each student or pair needs:

- Three ten-frames for each student or pair of students (download PDF for black line master)

- 30 counters or unifix cubes per pair of students

- One small dry-erase board and dry-erase maker per pair of students

Actions

The teacher reads the book to the class and asks, “How many things do you think the caterpillar ate in this story?” The students take a minute to share their estimate with a partner. Next, the teacher readsThe Very Hungry Caterpillaragain. After each page, the teacher pauses so that the students can add counters or unifix cubes to the ten-frame to represent the number of things the caterpillar ate, and then write an equation on the dry-erase board connecting addition to the number of counters used. After each ten-frame is filled in the students move to the next one. If the students are working in pairs, one student can add the counters/unifix cubes to the ten-frame while the other student writes the equation. By the end of the story, there should be a total of 25 food items eaten and 1 leaf eaten. (The students can decide as a class whether to count the leaf as a food). There will be two ten-frames completed with 5 or 6 counters/unifix cubes on the third ten-frame. If students come up with different, but correct, equations, then discuss the different equations and ask students, "Can all of these be correct?"

##
Solution

An example of what the students will be doing as the story is read:

After 1 apple and 2 pears are eaten, there will be 3 counters on the ten-frame. The equation will be 1+2=3.

After 1 apple, 2 pears, and 3 plums are eaten, there will be 6 counters on the ten-frame. The equation could be either 3+3=6 or 1+2+3=6.

After 1 apple, 2 pears, 3 plums, and 4 strawberries are eaten, 4 more counters would be added to the ten-frame for a total of ten counters. The equation could be 6+4=10, 3+3+4=10, or 1+2+3+4=10.

Materials

- Copies of a table of sums for numbers 1 through 9:

- Colored markers or crayons

Actions

- Ask the students to shade in the 10's in the table. What do they notice about where these 10's are in the table?

- Point out that if they start from the 10 in the bottom left corner and follow the red arrows shown below, they get to another 10:

Ask them to explain what that path means and why they get to another 10.

- Point out that if they start from the 10 in the 5+5 box and follow the purple arrows shown above, they get to another 10. Ask them to explain what that path means and why they get to another 10.

##
Solution

-

Students will likely use many different coloring schemes. Here is an example where the 10's are all shaded in green:

The 10's are on the diagonal going from the bottom left of the table to the top right.

-

The 10 in the bottom left is in the 9+1 box. Following the first red arrow moves us to the 8+1 box. This is 9, one less than 10. The second red arrow moves us to the 8+2 box. This is one more than 8+1=9 so it is also a 10.

Moving up one box subtracts one from 10 and moving to the right one box adds one to 9. After subtracting one and adding one we still have 10.

-

Two boxes to the left of 5+5 = 10 is 5+3 = 8. This is two less than 10. Moving down two boxes takes us to 7+3. This is two more than 5+3 = 8 so it is also a 10. <\p>

Moving two boxes to the left subtracts two from 10 and moving down two boxes adds two to 8. After subtracting two and adding two we will still have 10.

1.OA Using lengths to represent equality

##
Task

Materials

Cuisenaire rods or paper strips cut to whole centimeter lengths

Actions

Students work in pairs.

-

One student puts a few rods (or strips) end-to-end.

-

The other student matches that length with a different combination of rods (or strips).

-

When two different ways of making the same length are found, the students write a number sentence reflecting the equality.

For example, if the first student uses a rod of length 4, a rod of length 2 and a rod of length 1 and the second student uses three rods of length 2 and a rod of length 1 (as shown below), they should write $4+2+1=2+2+2+1.$

$${\Large 4+2+1=2+2+2+1}$$

##
Solution

For example, if the first student arranges Cuisenaire end to end like this (in this example there are 3 rods)

then the second student could use Cuisenaire rods to match the total length like this

The two students then write a number sentence to describe the relationship. $$\large{3+2+2=4+1+1+1}$$

Task

Find the missing number in each of the following equations: $$ 9 - 3 = \square \qquad \qquad 8 + \square = 15 \qquad \qquad 16 - \square = 5 $$ $$\square = 7 - 2 \qquad \qquad 13 = \square + 7 \qquad \qquad 6 = 14 - \square$$

##
Solution

We know that if we subtract 3 from nine, the result is 6 so the missing number in the first equation is 6. The first equation should look like: $$9-3=6$$ We can either count up from 8 to 15 or subtract 8 from 15. In either case, the result is 7. The second equation should look like: $$8+7=15$$ We can ask, “What number do we need to subtract from 16 to get 5?” or “5 plus what number is 16?” In either case, the answer is 11. The third equation should look like: $$16-11=5$$ We know that if we subtract 2 from seven, the result is 5 so the missing number in the first equation is 5. The first equation should look like: $$5=7-2$$ We can either count up from 7 to 13 or subtract 7 from 13. In either case, the result is 6. The second equation should look like: $$13 = 6 + 7$$ We can ask, “What number do we need to subtract from 14 to get 6?” or “6 plus what number is 14?” In either case, the answer is 8. The third equation should look like: $$6 = 14 - 8$$ We have found the missing numbers in each of the given equations.

##

-

Which pictures show one half of the shape shaded? Explain.

-

-

-

-

- Is more or less than one half of the shape shaded in (ii)? Explain.

- Is more or less than one half of the shape shaded in (iv)? Explain.

##
Solution

-

- One half of the circle is shaded because the shaded region and the unshaded region have the same shape and size, making each one half of the full circle. This is perhaps the picture most frequently associated with the words "half of a circle" or "semi-circle."

- Less than one half of this circle is shaded. Visually, the shaded area is far less then the unshaded area while the two would be equal if the shaded area represented one half of the circle. Mathematically, the shaded area represents one third of the circle since one of three equal pieces is shaded. One way to see this is to note that if a cookie is divided into 3 equal shares, each share is less than if the same cookie is divided into two equal shares.

- One half of this rectangle is shaded. This can be seen geometrically as the shape and size of the black triangle is identical to the shape and size of the white triangle, making each one half of the whole rectangle. Concretely, if the rectangle is cut in half and then the white triangle is rotated by $180$ degrees about the center of the rectangle, then it will lie precisely on top of the black triangle.

- More than one half of this rectangle is shaded. Visually the black shaded piece is far larger than the white unshaded piece and so this picture does not show one half.

-

In picture (ii), the shaded area is equal to each of the two unshaded pieces and so the unshaded area is larger than the shaded area (twice as large). So the shaded area represents less than one half.

-

In picture (iv), the shaded part of the rectangle is larger than the unshaded part and so the shaded area is more than one half of the area of the rectangle. Unlike picture (ii) which represents one third, however, the lower picture does not provide enough information to conclude precisely what fraction of the rectangle is shaded.

2.MD Hand Span Measures

##
Task

Hand span is a measure of distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger with the hand fully extended.

- Each student places his or her dominant hand on the edge of a piece of paper with the hand fully extended.

- The student should make a mark at the tip of the thumb and the tip of the little finger. The distance between marks is the length of the hand span.

- The student should measure his or her hand span with a centimeter ruler and round the measurement to the nearest whole centimeter.

- Each student should record his or her measurement on a piece of paper.

The teacher can ask each student for his or her measurement and record the data using a line plot with a horizontal scale marked off in whole centimeters. Alternatively, the teacher can set up the line plot and ask each student to come record his or her own hand span, showing the students how by recording the teacher's hand span.

Students should comment about patterns they observe the line plot and write or discuss the answers to these two questions:

-

What are the largest and smallest spans? What is the difference between the largest and smallest spans?

-

Use words to describe the shape of the data set. Does it appear taller in the center like a mountain? Are there peaks in more than one place? Is the shape of the data flat like a table top? Are there gaps? Are some hand spans much bigger or smaller than the others?

##
Solution

Students from ages 6 – 12 usually have a span in the range of 15 to 20 cm, with an average of about 17 cm. The teacher or students should record class data by placing an X above the appropriate number on the horizontal scale for each hand span that is measured. Or, provide a square post-it note to each student. Each student records his or her hand span on the note and posts it directly above the appropriate number on the horizontal line plot. The scale on the graph should match the size of the post-it notes. Post-it notes should be placed edge-to-edge and should not overlap.

Here is data from Jackie Giacalone's 2nd grade classes at Waukesha STEM Academy – Randall Campus in Waukesha, WI:

-

The difference between the largest and smallest measures is the range. This number is helpful in describing the “spread” of the data.

-

Encourage students to think of the data as a collection of points that form a shape or picture. They should use their own words to describe the shape and any interesting features of the data set.

1, 2.MD Favorite Ice Cream Flavor

##
Task

Materials

- Pocket chart

- Sentence strip

- Square pieces of paper for each student

- Popsicle sticks

Setup

Write a question that has three choices as an answer on a sentence strip. For example,

“Which flavor of ice cream do you like best?”

Put the three categories on the bottom of the pocket chart. For example,

Chocolate Vanilla Strawberry

Write interpretation questions on the popsicle sticks. For example,

- “How many students answered this question?”

- “Which has the most?”

- “Which has the fewest?”

- “Are any the same?”

- “How many are in each category?”

Actions

Begin with all students sitting together in the meeting area. Read the question aloud to the students, and ask individual students to answer the question by putting a paper square above their answer. Ensure that as each child answers, they put their paper above the previous square, not to the side of the square. When each child has answered, you will have a bar graph with three categories.

Draw a popsicle stick and model answering the question to the whole group. Divide students into five groups and have each group pick a popsicle stick. Students then read the question on the popsicle stick, discuss the question as a group, and then answer it in front of the class using the graph as a model to defend their answer.

##
Solution

Once students have all placed their squares in the pocket chart, you will have a bar graph with three categories. Here are some examples of student answers to two of the questions:

How many students answered this question?

“Eighteen students answered the question. I know because I counted up all the squares and there are 18 of them.”

Which has the most?

“Chocolate has the most students who prefer it. I know because the bar for chocolate is taller than the bars for the other flavors.”

- 90 + 300 + 4 = ______

##
Solution

-

140, 140.

The first problem asks for the same number (140) in different ways. This emphasizes that order doesn’t matter in addition – yet order is everything when using place-value notation.

-

14 tens = 10 tens + 4 tens

14 tens = 1 hundred+4 tens

14 tens = 140.

In this problem, the base‐ten units in 140 are bundled in different ways. In the first line, “tens” are thought of as units: 14 things = 10 things + 4 things.

-

507.

By scrambling the usual order, the third problem requires students to link the values of the parts with the order of the digits in the positional system. Also, to encode the quantity, the student will have to think: “no tens,” emphasizing the role of 0.

7 ones + 5 hundreds = 507

-

800.

In the fourth problem, the zeros come with a silent “no tens and no ones”:

8 hundreds = 800

-

106 = 1 hundred + 0 tens + 6 ones

106 = 10 tens + 6 ones

106 = 106 ones

In this problem, the base-ten units in 106 are bundled in different ways. This is helpful when learning how to subtract in a problem like 106 – 34 by thinking about 106 as 100 tens and 6 ones.

-

394.

The sixth problem is meant to illustrate the notion that If the order is always given “correctly,” then all we do is teach students rote strategies without thinking about the size of the units or how to encode them in positional notation.

90 + 300 + 4 = 394

2.OA, NBT Saving Money 2

##
Task

Louis wants to give \$15 to help kids who need school supplies. He also wants to buy a pair of shoes for \$39.

- How much money will he have to save for both?

- Louis gets \$5 a week for his allowance. He plans to save his allowance every week. How many weeks does it take him to reach this goal?

- Louis remembers his sister’s birthday is next month. He sets a goal of saving \$16 for her gift. How many weeks does he have to save his allowance to reach this goal? How many weeks does he have to save his allowance for all three of his goals?

##
Solutions

Solution: Using an empty number line

-

Louis needs to save 15+39 dollars:

\begin{aligned} 15 + 39 &=& \\ 10 + 5 + 30 + 9 &=&\\ 10 + 30 + 5 + 9 &=&\\ 40 + 10 + 4 &=&\\ 54. \end{aligned}

So Louis needs to save \$54.

- If we count up by fives, we can see how long it will take:So it will take Louis 11 weeks to save enough money for both.

-

If we look at the number line above, we can see it will take Louis 4 weeks to save enough for his sister's birthday present.

To save enough for all three, Louis needs to save 54+16 dollars:

\begin{aligned} 54 + 16&=&\\ 50 + 4 + 10 + 6 &= &\\ 60 + 10 &=&\\ 70. \end{aligned}

So Louis needs to save \$70 for all three things. If we continue to count by fives:we can see that it will take him 14 weeks all together. The reason it took one less week than if we had added up the number of weeks we found above is that the extra money earned in the 4th week above and beyond what he needed for his sister's present combined with the extra money saved in the 11th week equals one week's allowance.

Solution: Recording the savings in a table

-

Louis needs to save 15+39 dollars:

\begin{aligned} 15 + 39 &=& \\ 10 + 5 + 30 + 9 &=&\\ 10 + 30 + 5 + 9 &=&\\ 40 + 10 + 4 &=&\\ 54. \end{aligned}

So Louis needs to save \$54.

- If we count up by fives, we can see how long it will take:

WeekAmount saved

1\$5.00

2\$10.00

3\$15.00

4\$20.00

5\$25.00

6\$30.00

7\$35.00

8\$40.00

9\$45.00

10\$50.00

11\$55.00

So it will take Louis 11 weeks to save enough money for both.

- If we look in the table above, we can see it will take Louis 4 weeks to save enough for his sister's birthday present.

Louis needs to save 54+16 dollars:

\begin{aligned} 54 + 16&=&\\ 50 + 4 + 10 + 6 &= &\\ 60 + 10 &=&\\ 70. \end{aligned}

So Louis needs to save \$70 for all three things. If we extend the table above, we can see how long it will take:

WeekAmount saved

12\$60.00

13\$65.00

14\$70.00

The reason it took one less week than if we had added up the number of weeks is that the extra money earned in the 4th week above and beyond what he needed for his sister's present combined with the extra money saved in the 11th week equals one week's allowance.

- $347 + 30$ ______ $397 - 10 - 10$

- $126 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10$ ______ $96 - 10$

##
Solution

-

$657 = 457+100+100$. Many approaches are possible for comparing the numbers on each side, such as:

- Both sides have a 57 and some hundreds. On the left there are 6 hundreds, and on the right there are 4 hundreds plus 2 more. So there are 6 hundreds on each side, and the two sides are equal.

- Students could notice that the tens and ones digits of the numbers on either side will be equal, and then skip-count by 100s:Four hundred fifty-seven, five hundred fifty-seven, six hundred fifty-seven.... So the numbers on both sides are equal: 657 = 457+100+100.

- This process could also be visualized on a number line, which shows the size of the terms being added:

- Of course students could also add the numbers 457, 100, and 100 vertically. That doesn’t stress thinking about the sizes of the base-ten units, however. So suppose we merely visualize doing this, rather than going to the trouble to write it down—then because of all the zeros, we can see that the tens digit of the sum will be 5 and the ones digit will be 7, while the hundreds digit will be 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. (From this one can see the relationship between the meanings of the digits, place value notation, and the vertical method.)

-

$926 \gt 726+100+10$. Some possible approaches:

- On the left there are 9 hundreds, and on the right there are 7 hundreds plus 1 more hundred. So there are 9 hundreds on the left and 8 hundreds on the right. On the right there are 26+10 ones as well, which is still less than 100, so the left is greater than the right hand side.

- If the right-hand side were 726 + 100 + 100, then it would be like part (a): "726, 826, 926." But we won’t get to 926 because the last term added is much smaller than 100. So 926 $\gt$ 726 + 100 + 10.

- Showing this on a number line:

-

$511 + 10 + 10 + 10 \gt 531 - 10 - 10$. Some possible approaches:

-

There are 5 hundreds on each side and 1 one on each side. There are 4 tens on the left and 3 minus 2 tens on the right. So the left is greater than the right hand side.

- Adding three 10's to 511: 521, 531, 541. Subtracting two 10's from 531: 521, 511. So 511 + 10 + 10 + 10 $\gt$ 531 - 10 - 10.

- Showing this on a number line:

-

$923 \lt 953-10-10$. Some possible approaches:

-

Both sides have a 900 and a 3 and some tens. On the left there are 2 tens, and on the right there are 5 tens minus 2 tens, which is 3 tens. So the left hand side is smaller.

-

Subtracting two 10's from 953: 943, 933. Adding 10 to 923 gets us to 933 as well. So 923 + 10 = 953-10-10.

- Showing this on a number line:

-

$100+100+300+10 = 510$. Some possible approaches:

-

Both sides have 1 ten and some hundreds. On the left we have a hundred plus a hundred plus 3 hundreds, for a total of 5 hundreds. On the right there are also 5 hundreds, so the two sides are equal.

-

Starting at 100, then adding another 100 gets us to 200. Adding 300 gets us to 500 since 2 hundreds plus 3 hundreds is 5 hundreds. 10 more is 510. So 100+100+300+10 = 510.

- Showing this on a number line:

-

$347+30 = 397-10-10$. Some possible approaches:

-

Both sides have 3 hundreds and a 7 and some tens. On the left we have a 4 tens from the 347 and 3 tens from the 30, for a total of 7 tens. On the right we have a 9 tens minus 2 tens, which is also 7 tens. So the two sides are equal.

-

30 more than 347 is 377 since 4 tens plus 3 tens is 7 tens. Subtracting two 10's from 397 gets us to 387 then 377. So 347+30 = 397-10-10.

- Showing this on a number line:

-

$126-10-10-10-10 = 96-10$. Some possible approaches:

-

Both sides have a 6. Since the left side has 1 hundred and the right side does not, it will be easier to compare the two sides if we break the hundred into 10 tens and compare the number of tens. Then on the left we have 10 tens, plus 2 more tens from the 20, minus 4 tens, for a total of 8 tens. On the right side we have 9 tens minus 1 ten, so we also have 8 tens. So the two sides are equal.

-

Subtracting four 10's from 126: 116, 106, 96, 86. This is the same as subtracting one 10 from 96. So 126-10-10-10-10 = 96-10.

### Cluster `B` — Use Place Value Understanding AndProperties Of OperationsTo Add And Subtract (*Major*)

#### `2.NBT.B.5` Task

This example task comes from a video from Global Education Resources, which can be foundhere.

The joint purpose of this task is to provide students an opportunity to practice two-digit subtraction with regrouping and to engage students in looking for and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning (MP.8). Throughout grade 2, students need many opportunities to practice subtraction in order to achieve fluency subtracting within 100 by the end of the grade. For students in grade 2, it is sufficient for them to recognize that differences of 9 will stem from numbers whose digits differ by 1, subtractions resulting in 18 will stem from numbers whose digits differ by 2, etc.

Task: Actions

The teacher sets the stage by letting students know that today they will investigate an interesting thing that happens when subtracting certain numbers. (For an illustration of this, please see video, start-1:17)

The investigation begins with the teacher displaying the digits 1 through 9 on the board. S/he chooses two digits and asks the class what possible two-digit numbers they can make. (For an illustration of this, please see video, 1:17-2:16)

The teacher then asks students to find the difference between the numbers they created. (The problem and the difference should be recorded on the subtraction template.) The teacher leads students through a second example, making sure to choose digits that will have the same result as the first example. (For an illustration of this, please see video, 2:16-5:10)

The teacher then asks the students if the result will always be the same when subtracting two two-digit numbers made from the same pair of digits and challenges them to find out. Students can work independently or with partners using the subtraction template. As the students work, the teacher has the opportunity to encourage students to try different digit combinations and support any students who are subtracting incorrectly. After enough time has passed, the teacher has the students put their results (subtraction templates or equations) on the board. (For an illustration of this, please see video, 5:10-6:55)

Once the results are all on the board, the class discussion begins. (For an illustration of this, please see video, 6:55-13:56) Follow up questions the teacher may ask include, but are not limited to:

- Were all of our answers the same?

- What are all the differences that our class found?

- Do you think we missed any possible differences?

- Is there anything special about the differences we found?

- With your partner, discuss one or two interesting things you wrote down about the results of this investigation.

Task: Solution

Having worked extensively with place value in grade 1 (1.NBT.B), students should come to grade 2 able to make both possible two-digit numbers from any given two digits.

The answers for the subtraction problems are dependent upon the numbers chosen, but are always multiples of 9 (e.g., if the digits 5 and 9 are selected, the numbers 59 and 95 are possible. When subtracting 59 from 95, the result is 36, a multiple of 9.).

The students should notice that when their subtraction result is 9, the difference of the two digits used is 1 (the numbers are consecutive or adjacent). When the result is 18, the difference is 2 (the numbers are “neighbors”). And so on. Some students may also notice that the digits in the results have a sum of nine if they are added together.

Other possible routes:

23 + 51 + 3 + 24 = 101

23 + 25 + 29 + 24 = 101

23 + 25 + 40 + 38 = 126

2.NBT How Many Days Until Summer Vacation?

##
Task

Materials

* Paper * Pencil * Hundreds board * Base-ten blocks

Actions

Pose this problem to the children: We are in school 180 days. Today is the 124th day of school. How many more days until we are out of school for summer vacation? Explain how you know.

##
Solutions

Solution: 3

Using base-ten blocks:

Start with 1 hundred, 8 tens, 0 ones. We can’t take away 4 ones from 0 ones so we have to break a ten into 10 ones. I now have 7 tens 10 ones. Now we can subtract using the take-away model.

10 - 4 = 6.

70 - 20 = 50.

100 - 100 = 0.

So there are 56 days of school before we get out for summer vacation. Here is a picturing showing the 100s, 10s and 1s.

Solution: 1

Count by ones to the next decade: 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130. So we have added 6.

Then count by tens: 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, which makes 5 tens or 50.

Since 50 + 6 = 56, there are 56 days left before we get out of school for summer vacation.

Students can use the 100s board or draw an "empty number line" to help them count.

Solution: 2

Count by tens from 124: 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184. That is 6 tens or 60.

But 184 is too big so count back to 180, which is 4.

Subtract 4 from 60 to get 56. We have 56 days of school left.

2.NBT Choral Counting

##
Task

Materials

- Chart paper

- Marker

Actions

The teacher will begin by asking a student volunteer to show 3 using base-ten blocks. The teacher will then record 3 on the chart. The teacher will then ask how students can show the number that is 10 more and invite another student volunteer to build 10 more with cubes. Student may add 10 individual units or a ten stick. The goal is for students to move from counting ten units to counting one unit of 10, and to connect the concrete representations of the numbers with abstract oral counting. The teacher will then record 13 on the chart and continue this process, asking students “What’s 10 more than __?” and have student volunteers show 10 more with the base-ten blocks. At some point, a student will likely use a ten stick instead of ten ones; when this happens, the teacher can help the students see this is a more efficient strategy. If no students add a ten stick, the teacher can help them make this transition.

The goal of writing the numbers on the chart paper as shown below is to record the numbers in a way that makes the "add ten" pattern visible for students. By recording 10 numbers in a row, students may see patterns in tens as they look across, and also hundreds as they look vertically.

3132333435363738393

103113123133143153163173183193

203

Throughout the process, the teacher should pose questions to elicit student thinking and understanding of the concept of 10, 100, and patterns within the structure of our base ten number system. Questions may include:

- What do you notice?

- Why do you think that is?

- What number will be next? How do you know?

- What’s happening to the digit in the tens place? Why?

- What’s happening to the digit in the ones place? Why?

- Why do the numbers build like that?

- What’s the relationship between _ and _?

- What patterns do you notice looking horizontally?

- What patterns do you notice looking vertically?

- What number will be below __ ? How do you know?

- What number will be at the end of the fourth row? How do you know?

Closing: Ask students, “How might this task help you solve 38+10? 124+10? Support students in making connections to choral counting activity and mentally adding or subtracting 10 (or 100) from any given number 100-900.

##
Solution

Throughout the task, students will identify the number that is 10 more in the counting sequence. Through teacher questioning, some ideas that may emerge from the experience include:

- All of the numbers end in the three.

- If we don’t look at the 3 in each number, the numbers are counting, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

- Numbers in the ones place are not changing.

- Numbers in the tens place are changing and growing by 1.

- When looking at the columns, the numbers grow by 100.

- When looking at the columns, the digits in the ones and tens places do not change but the digits in the hundreds place increase by 1.

- The numbers grow by 100 when looking down because there are 10 numbers in each row and 10 groups of 10 is 100.

- 213 will come next because it is 10 more than 203 and 113 is above it.

- The next row will begin with 303 because that is 100 more than 203.

- 393 will be at the end of the fourth row because if each row is 100 more, 193+100=293, 293+100=393.

Closing:

38+10=48

124+10=134

I can use what I know about counting to find 10 more than any number. I can start at the given number and count by tens. I also noticed that when adding 10 more, the only number that changed is the number in the tens place so I know that 10 more than 124 is 134.

2.OA Hitting The Target Number

##
Task

Materials

- Number cards labeled 1-10 (attached as a PDF)

Actions

-

Begin by playing the game as a whole class to demonstrate the rules and for students to illustrate the range of possible strategies.

-

Have a student pick 5 number cards from the cards labeled 1 through 10. Then, have another student pick a “Target Number” between 10 through 20. Students must add and/or subtract 2 or more of the 5 number cards to arrive at the “target” number.

-

As students present the different number combinations for the “target” number, write their expressions on the board and have them explain how they were able to mentally come up with the solution.

-

As students explain their reasoning, name the strategies they used. For example, look for students making fives (e.g. 6 + 8 = 5 + 1 + 5 +3= 10 + 4 = 14) and tens (9 + 8 = 10 + 7), and using known facts (e.g. 8 + 8 is 16 so 8 + 7 is one less than 16) to encourage flexible thinking about the relationship among the facts.

-

When students understand how the game works, they can play in pairs, checking each other's solutions.

##
Solution

Suppose the five number cards selected are 5, 3, 8, 1, and 9 and a target number is 16.

- 5 + 3 + 8. 5 and 3 is 8 and doubles 8 is 16.

Another strategy:

- Break apart the 8 into 5 and 3. Add the two 5s to make 10 and the two 3s to make 6. Then add 10 and 6 to make 16.

Lin wants to put some red and blue tiles on a wall for decoration. She is thinking about several different patterns of tiles she could create. She wants to choose a pattern that would let her use exactly as many red tiles as blue tiles.

-

Is it possible to create the pattern below using the same number of red tiles as blue tiles? Explain.

-

Is it possible to create the pattern below using the same number of red tiles as blue tiles? Explain.

-

Can you figure out how many tiles are in the pattern below without counting them one by one? Is it possible to create this pattern using the same number of red tiles as blue tiles? Explain.

-

Of the patterns above, which ones have an even number of tiles? Which ones have an odd number of tiles? If Lin wants to use an equal number of red tiles and blue tiles, should she use a pattern with an even number of tiles, or one with an odd number of tiles? Explain.

##
Solution

This solution uses the language of even and odd even though the task statement does not. For students who are already familiar with that terminology, it would be great if they recognize that it is appropriate here and use it. For students who are not familiar with it, this task provides a great opportunity for teachers to introduce it.

-

The first arrangement can be divided into two equal parts; for example, we can divide the pattern into the top half and the bottom half. This means that the number of tiles in this arrangement is even.

-

If we try pairing tiles in the second seating arrangement, we end up with one tile left over. Therefore, the number of tiles in this arrangement is odd.

-

The tiles in this arrangement are in a 4-by-4 array, so the total number of tiles is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16. Again, we can divide this arrangement into a top half and a bottom half, so the number of tiles is even.

-

When the number of tiles is even, Leslie can divide the tiles into two equal-sized groups, one to be made of red tiles and one to be made of blue tiles. She can then create the pattern using an equal number of tiles of each color. When the number of tiles is odd, there will have to be a color (red or blue) that has at least one more tile than the other color. Therefore, Leslie should use a pattern with an even number of tiles if she wants to use the same number of red and blue tiles.

For each picture, decide whether one half of the circle is shaded or not. Explain how you know.

-

##
Solutions

Solution: Student solution

a. If I imagine a line through the center like the one below, then I can see two small triangles that are the same size and shape. If the shaded and unshaded triangles switch places, I can see that half the circle is shaded.

b. If I imagine moving the two unshaded pieces together, I can see that they don't fill up half the circle. So more than half must be shaded.

c. The circle is in 4 equal parts and 2 are shaded. So half the circle is shaded.

d. The small shaded piece on the left is the same size as the unshaded piece on the right. I imagined that those two pieces traded places, so that I could see that half the circle is shaded.

Solution: 1

-

This picture represents one half. The shaded area is equal in size and shape to the unshaded area: this can be shown by rotating the picture, about the center of the circle, by $180$ degrees so that the black and white parts trade places. Alternatively, if the shape is cut, the white part is the same shape and size as the black part.

-

This picture does not represent one half. The shaded part is visually larger than the unshaded part. Cutting out the unshaded pieces will show that the unshaded part is in fact equal to one of the two equal shaded pieces so that the shaded part actually represents two thirds of the circle.

-

This picture represents $\frac{2}{4}$ as there are four equally sized pieces and two of them are shaded. Since $\frac{2}{4}$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}$ the shaded portion of this picture does represent one half. Another way to see this would be to cut out the two shaded and unshaded pieces and observe that each shaded piece is identical in shape and size to an unshaded piece making the shaded and unshaded areas equal.

-

This picture is a creative and interesting way to represent one half of a circle. To see that the shaded part represents one half of the circle, notice that this picture becomes identical to picture (c) if the lower right shaded slice of the circle is moved over next to the lower left shaded slice. Alternatively, the picture can be rotated counterclockwise by $90$ degrees and the shaded and unshaded parts trade places and so they must be equal. Thirdly, we can observe that each shaded piece may be paired up with an unshaded piece of equal size so again the shaded and unshaded areas must be equal, meaning that the shaded area represents one half of the whole circle.

3.NBT How Many Colored Pencils?

##
Task

There are 6 tables in Mrs. Potter's art classroom. There are 4 students sitting at each table. Each student has a box of 10 colored pencils.

(A) How many colored pencils are at each table?

(B) How many colored pencils do Mrs. Potter's students have in total?

##
Solutions

Solution: 1

-

There are 4 students each with ten pencils at each table.

There are 10, 20, 30, 40 pencils all together.

-

There are 6 tables with 4 boxes with ten pencils each.

We can combine the 4 boxes from 2 tables to get 8 boxes, and then take 2 from one table to get 10 boxes. We can do this twice.

This means there are 2 groups of 10 boxes which is 200 pencils, with 4 groups of ten pencils in addition to that.

So there are 240 pencils all together.

Solution: 2

-

Each student has a box of 10 pencils, which is one group of 10. There are 4 students at each table, so there are 4 groups of 10 pencils or $4\times 10$ pencils at each table. We also know that the "4" in the number 40 means "4 tens" so we know there are 40 pencils at each table.

-

First, there are $4\times 10$ pencils at each table. Since there are 6 tables, and 40 pencils at each table, there are $6\times 40$ pencils in total. This 40 arose as 4 groups of 10, or, $4\times 10$, so there are $$6\times (4\times 10)$$ pencils in total. By the associative property of multiplication, this is also $(6\times 4)\times 10 = 24\times 10$ pencils. 24 tens is 240, so there are 240 pencils in total.

Solution: 3

-

There are 40 pencils at one table.

-

There are 240 pencils all together.

3.NF Snow Day

##
Task

Alec and Felix are brothers who go to different schools. The school day is just as long at Felix' school as at Alec's school. At Felix' school, there are 6 class periods of the same length each day. Alec's day is broken into 3 class periods of equal length. One day, it snowed a lot so both of their schools started late. Felix only had four classes and Alec only had two. Alec claims his school day was shorter than Felix' was because he had only two classes on that day. Is he right?

##
Solution

Felix has six equal class periods each day.

So each class period lasts for $\frac16$ of the day.

Alec has three equal class periods each day.

So each class period lasts for $\frac13$ of the day.

Felix only had 4 class periods, so he went to school for $\frac46$ of a full day. Alec only had 2 class periods, so he went to school for $\frac23$ of a full day.

But a full day is equal for the two brothers, so two of Felix' class periods are the same length as one of Alec's. The brothers actually went to school for the same amount of time on the snow day.

#
Plums

##
Task

Four situations are described below. In one situation, the number of plums is equal to 8 × 4. Which situation is it?

A. Hershel has 8 plums and gives 4 plums to each friend.

B. Jazmine makes 8 goodie bags with 4 plums in each bag.

C. Lawrence has 8 plums and Kaliyah has 4 more plums than Lawrence.

D. Sabrina has 8 ripe plums and 4 unripe plums.

##
Solution

Correct if student selects B: Jazmine makes 8 goodie bags with 4 plums in each bag.

The product 8 × 4 means the number of things in 8 groups of 4 things each, or the number of things in 4 groups of 8 things each. In situation B, there are 8 groups of plums with 4 plums in each group. So the number of plums in situation B is 8 × 4. The correct answer is B.

It is not necessary to calculate the value of the product 8 × 4 to answer the question. (The question is not about what 8 × 4 equals—the question is about what 8 × 4 means.)

In none of the other situations is the number of plums 8 × 4:

- In situation A, there are 8 plums. (Situation A could be thought of as a division situation because there are 8 ÷ 4 = 2 friends.)

- In situation C, there are 8 + (8 + 4) plums.

- In situation D, there are 8 + 4 plums.

If students have trouble answering this question, you might ask them to draw a diagram of each situation. Drawing the diagrams might help to clarify which operations are relevant to each situation.

3.OA Fish Tanks

##
Task

Suppose there are 4 tanks and 3 fish in each tank. The total number of fish in this situation can be expressed as $4 \times 3 = 12$.

- Describe what is meant in this situation by $12 \div 3 = 4$

- Describe what is meant in this situation by $12 \div 4 = 3$

##
Solution

The students' language may vary. What is important is the structure. The student needs to match what is known (either the number of groups or the amount in each group) and what is being determined by the quotient operation in this context.

-

Describe what is meant in this situation by 12 ÷ 3 = 4

Solution: There are 12 fish. If 3 fish are put in each tank there will be 4 tanks.

Comment: This is a measurement model of division, the number of objects in each group is known, and we are determining the number of groups.

-

Describe what is meant in this situation by 12 ÷ 4 = 3

Solution: There are 12 fish. If we want to partition (share) them equally among 4 tanks, we will end up with 3 fish in each tank.

Comment: This a sharing model of division, the number of groups is known and we are trying to determine the number in each group.

- Helen spent an equal amount of money on each of her 7 grandchildren at the fair. If she spent a total of \$42, how much did each grandchild get?

##
Solutions

Solution: Tape diagram

This task needs a tape diagram solution; one is under development.

Solution: Writing multiplication equations for division problems

- Sandra spent 6 groups of \$9, which is $6 \times 9 = 54$ dollars all together.

- Since the number of games represent the number of groups, but we don’t know how many games she bought, this is a "How many groups?" division problem. We can represent it as $$? \times 8 = 48$$ or $$48 \div 8 = ?$$ So Nita must have bought 6 games.

- Here we know how many grandchildren there are (so we know the number of groups), but we don’t know how much money each one gets (the number of dollars in each group). So this is a "How many in each group?" division problem. We can represent it as $$7 \times ? = 42$$ or $$42 \div 7 = ?$$ So Helen must have given each grandchild \$6.

- 3 x 6 = 9 x 2

- 5 x 8 = 10 x 4

- 8 x 6 = 7 x 6 + 6

- 4 x (10 + 2) = 40 + 2

##
Solution

Decide if the equations are true or false. Explain your answer.

- 4 x 5 = 20 This is true. Both sides have a value of 20.

- 34 = 7 x 5 This is not true. The value of 7 x 5 is 35. Students may also recognize that all multiples of 5 end in 0 or 5 and conclude that this equation is not true without evaluating 7 x 5.

- 3 x 6 = 9 x 2 This is true. Both sides have a value of 18.

- 5 x 8 = 10 x 4 This is true. Both sides have a value of 40. Additional information from the Commentary: Students will likely know these facts relatively quickly and come to the conclusion that both sides are equal to 40, thus this equation is true. When pressed to see other options, students may reason that the 8 can be broken down into 4 x 2. The equation becomes 5 x (2 x 4) = 10 x 4. Through the associative property, this becomes (5 x 2) x 4 = 10 x 4. We can see that these expressions are equivalent because we know that 5 x 2 has the same value as 10.

- 6 x 9 = 5 x 10 This is not true. The value of 6 x 9 is 54 and the value of 5 x 10 is 50. This is included to see if students mistakenly try to use compensation strategies from addition.

- 2 x (3 x 4) = 8 x 3 This is true. Both sides have a value of 24. See the commentary for further suggestions on what ideas to elicit from students.

- 8 x 6 = 7 x 6 + 6 This is true. Both sides have a value of 48. Additional information from the Commentary: third graders understand multiplication in terms of equal groups. Students might reason that 8 x 6 means 8 groups of 6. Thus 7 x 6 + 6 would mean 7 groups of 6 with another group of 6. Students might recognize that extra 6 as the "8th group of 6" thereby making the two expressions equivalent.

- 4 x (10 + 2) = 40 + 2 This is not true. 4 x (10 + 2) has a value of 48, and 40 + 2 has a value of 42. This equation presents an opportunity for students to reason using the distributive property.

3.OA Making a ten

##
Task

Below is a table showing all the ways to add the numbers from 1 to 9.

- Each sum which is larger than 10 can be found by first making a 10. For example, to find 8 + 5, we can write

\begin{align} 8+5 &= 8 + (2+3) \\ &= (8+2) + 3 \\ &= 10 + 3 \\ &= 13. \end{align}

Explain why this reasoning works and apply this method to find 7 + 8. How can you visualize these equations using the table?

- Adding 9 to another single digit number can also be done by first making a 10. For example

\begin{align} 3+9 &= 3 + (10-1) \\ &= (3+10) - 1 \\ &= 13 - 1 \\ &= 12. \end{align}

Explain why this reasoning works and apply this method to find 7+9. How can you visualize these equations using the table?

##
Solution

-

The first equation comes from writing 5 as 2+3. The reason for this is that in the next step we will group the 2 together with the 8 to make a 10. This second step uses the associative property of addition. In the third step, we add 10 + 3 to find the answer of 13.

In terms of the addition table, we can visualize adding 5 to 8 by starting at the 8 in the column of addends and moving over 5 spaces to the right. Notice that after two steps, we reach 10. Then three more steps puts us at 13. This is shown in the picture below:

Applying this method to calculate 7+8 we find

\begin{align} 7+8 &= 7 + (3+5) \\ &= (7+3) + 5 \\ &= 10 + 5 \\ &= 15. \end{align}

-

This method is similar to the making a ten method in part (b). In this case, however, a ten is made by rewriting 9 as 10 - 1. Then the 3 and 10 are grouped together first before performing the subtraction in the final step. This is shown in the picture below:

Applying this method to find 7+9 gives

\begin{align} 7+9 &= 7 + (10-1) \\ &= (7+10) - 1 \\ &= 17 - 1 \\ &= 16. \end{align}

4.G The Geometry of Letters

##
Task

Letters can be thought of as geometric figures.

-

How many line segments are needed to make the letter A? How many angles are there? Are they acute, obtuse, or right angles? Are any of the line segments perpendicular? Are any of the line segments parallel?

- We can build all of these letters from line segments and arcs of circles. Build all of the capital letters with the smallest number of "pieces," where each piece is either a line segment or an arc of a circle.

- Which letters have perpendicular line segments?

- Which letters have parallel line segments?

- Which letters have no line segments?

- Do any letters contain both parallel and perpendicular lines?

- What makes the lower case letters "i" and "j" different than all of the capital letters?

##
Solution

-

The letter A is composed of 3 line segments which meet in three places and form 5 angles less than 180 degrees. Three of these angles are acute, and two are obtuse. Note that students might also count angles that are greater than 180 degrees, so it is important for students to explicitly identify the angles they see. For example, a student might see an angle greater than 180 degrees at the top of the letter A.

Alternatively, the a student might see the letter A as being composed of 5 line segments and see two straight-angles on the sides of the letter A where the horizontal segment meets them. Of course, this isn't the smallest number of pieces needed to build the letter A, but it is a correct decomposition and analysis of it.

None of the line segments are perpendicular or parallel.

-

The hardest ones are the ones composed of both segments and curves. B can be made from 4 segments and two semi-circles, for example:

-

These letters have perpendicular line segments:

B, D, E, F, H, L, P, R, T

For example, Here is an analysis of the letter B which is composed of 4 line segments (three of which are parallel to each other and are all perpendicular to the fourth) and two arcs of a circle:

-

These letters have parallel line segments:

B, D, E, F, H, M, N, R, U, Z

- These letters have no line segments: C, O, S. Depending on the font (or your handwriting), Q might or might not contain a line segment.

-

These letters have both parallel and perpendicular line segments:

B, D, E, F, H, R

- The lower case letters "i" and "j" are different than all of the capital letters because they are disconnected. That is, they are made out of pieces that don't touch.

4.MD Who is the tallest?

##
Task

Mr. Liu asked the students in his fourth grade class to measure their heights. Here are some of the heights they recorded:

StudentHeight

Sarah50 inches

Jake$4 \frac{1}{4}$ feet

Andy$1 \frac{1}{2}$ yards

Emily4 feet and 4 inches

List the four students from tallest to shortest.

##
Solution

To compare the measurements we convert them to inches. For this we need to know that there are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard. So there are $3 \times 12 = 36$ inches in a yard.

Sarah's height is already in inches. Jake's height is 4$\frac{1}{4}$ feet. This is the same as 4+$\frac{1}{4}$ feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are $4 \times 12 = 48$ inches in 4 feet, and $3$ inches in a a $\frac14$ foot. So Jake's height in inches is $48 + 3 = 51$ inches.

For Andy we have seen that there are 36 inches in a yard, so there are 18 inches in half a yard, so in inches Andy's height is $36 + 18 = 54$.

Finally Emily is 4 feet and 4 inches tall. There are $4 \times 12 = 48$ inches in 4 feet, so Emily is $48 + 4 = 52$ inches tall.

The table shows all the heights in inches, in decreasing order.

4.MD Margie Buys Apples

##
Task

Margie bought 3 apples that cost 50 cents each. She paid with a five-dollar bill. How much change did Margie receive?

##
Solutions

Solution: 1 Using cents as a unit

The apples cost 50 cents each so three apples cost 3 $\times$ 50 cents which is 150 cents. Margie paid 5 dollars. Since one dollar is 100 cents this means that 5 dollars is 5 $\times$ 100 = 500 cents.

So Margie will get back $$ 500 - 150 = 350 \,{\rm cents}. $$ This is the same as \$3.50.

Solution: 2 Using dollars and fractions

The apples cost 50 cents each. This is $\frac{1}{2}$ of a dollar. So two apples will cost 1 dollar and 3 apples cost an extra $\frac{1}{2}$ dollar making 1$\frac{1}{2}$ dollars. Margie paid 5 dollars.

So Margie will get back $$ 5- 1\frac{1}{2} \,{\rm dollars}. $$ Taking away one dollar leaves Margie with 4 dollars and taking away an additional half dollar means Margie will get back 3$\frac{1}{2}$ dollars or \$3.50.

Solution: 3 Using dollars and decimals from the start

The apples cost 50 cents each. Since one cent is 0.01 dollars, 50 cents is $0.50$ dollars. Two apples will cost 1 dollar and 3 apples cost an extra 50 cents making 1.50 dollars. Margie paid 5 dollars. So Margie will get back $$ 5- 1.50 \,{\rm dollars}. $$ Taking away one dollar leaves Margie with 4 dollars and taking away an additional 0.50 dollars means Margie will get back 3.50 dollars.

4.OA, MD Karl's Garden

##
Task

Karl's rectangular vegetable garden is 20 feet by 45 feet, and Makenna's is 25 feet by 40 feet. Whose garden is larger in area?

##
Solutions

Solution: 1

We multiply the length and the width to find the area of each rectangular garden. Since $$20 \times 45 = 900$$ we have that Karl's garden is 900 square feet.

We also know that $$25 \times 40 = 1,000$$

so Makenna's garden is 1,000 square feet.

Finally, we can find the difference of the two areas

$$1,000 - 900 = 100$$

and we see that Makenna's garden is larger by 100 square feet.

Solution: With pictures

If we draw pictures to scale, we can see this difference visually. First, draw the two rectangles to represent the two gardens; the blue rectangle represents Karl's garden and the yellow rectangle represents Makenna's garden:

Now, draw them overlapping. In the picture below, the green region shows where the rectangles overlap, the blue strip on the left shows the part of the blue rectangle that is not overlapped by the yellow rectangle, and the yellow strip on the bottom shows the part of the yellow rectangle that is not overlapped by the blue rectangle:

Note that the blue strip is 20 feet by 5 feet and has an area of 100 square feet. The yellow strip is 40 feet by 5 feet and has an area of 200 square feet. Since $$200-100 = 100$$ we have that Makenna's garden is 100 square feet larger than Karl's garden.

If students happen to display the misconception mentioned in the commentary, then these pictures could be used to help them understand why the areas are not equal.

- With a partner or group, gather a handful of round buttons from a diverse collection, and use a ruler to measure the diameter of each button to the nearest eighth-inch.

- Make a line plot of button diameters, marking your scale in eighth-inch increments.

- What is the most common diameter in your collection? How does that compare with the collection from another group?

- Now measure the diameters of these same buttons to the nearest quarter-inch.

- Make a line plot of button diameters, marking your scale in quarter-inch increments.

- Describe the differences between the two line plots you created. Which one gives you more information? Which one is easier to read?

-

Below is a line plot based on the data collected in part a.

-

In this collection, the most common diameter is $\frac38$ of an inch. That may vary some from other groups.

#
Angle Measure

##
Task

Four angles are shown below. One angle measures 60 degrees. Which angle is it?

##
Solution

Correct if student selects or writes angle A.

Potential Strategies

- Angle B looks like and is a right angle, and a right angle measures 90 degrees. So, angle B isn’t the angle that measures 60 degrees. Angles C and D both have measures greater than 90 degrees, so neither angle is the angle that measures 60 degrees. This leaves angle A as the only possible choice, and therefore the correct answer.

- If students have the printout of the task and a protractor to measure the angle, they will find that it indeed measures 60 degrees or thereabouts. However, if the student has a quantitative sense of angle measure, then they can apply that quantitative sense to answer the question without a protractor. Using a protractor makes this task more aligned to 4.MD.C.6

Potential Misconceptions

- If the student is having a hard time deciding about angle C, then you might encourage them to draw a line on angle C. This line could be used to conclude that angle C measures more than 90 degrees.:

- Draw another angle that measures 25 degrees. It should have the same vertex and share side $\overrightarrow{BA}$.

- How many angles are there in the figure you drew? What are their measures?

- Make a copy of your 60 degree angle. Draw a different angle that measures 25 degrees and has the same vertex and also shares side $\overrightarrow{BA}$.

- How many angles are there in the figure you drew? What are their measures?

##
Solution

-

Here is an angle, labelled $\angle ABC$, whose measure is 60$^\circ$:

-

Here is a picture of an angle, labelled $\angle ABD$, measuring 25$^\circ$ and sharing $\overrightarrow{BA}$ with $\angle ABC$:

-

The picture above has three angles. There is the original $\angle ABC$ which measures 60$^\circ$. There is $\angle ABD$ which we added and it measures 25$^\circ$. The third angle, $\angle CBD$, makes up $\angle ABC$ together with $\angle ABD$. This means that $$ \angle CBD + \angle ABD = \angle ABC. $$ We know that $\angle ABD = 25^\circ$ and $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$ so $$ \angle CBD = 60^\circ - 25^\circ = 35^\circ. $$

-

We can also make a 25$^\circ$ angle with ray $BA$ as pictured below (we labelled the fourth point $E$ to distinguish it from the point $D$ in the previous picture):

-

In this picture we again have $\angle ABC$ whose measure is 60$^\circ$. We have $\angle ABE$ whose measure is 25$^\circ$. Finally, there is $\angle CBE$ which is made up of $\angle ABE$ and $\angle ABC$ so $$ \angle CBE = 25^\circ + 60^\circ = 85^\circ. $$

4.NBT.1 Threatened and Endangered

##
Task

Maned wolves are a threatened species that live in South America. People estimate that there are about 24,000 of them living in the wild.

(Image above: Maned wolf)

The dhole is an endangered species that lives in Asia. People estimate there are ten times as many maned wolves as dholes living in the wild.

(Image above: Dhole)

About how many dholes are there living in the wild?

##
Solutions

Solution: 3

We can also use a place value organizer to think about dividing 24,000 by 10.

We know that no matter the number in our base ten system, if we divide by 10 then every digit will shift to the right in place value. This place value organizer shows how we can represent dividing 24,000 by 10 using place value.

Using this organizer, we can see that 24,000 divided by 10 is 2,400. Therefore, there are about 2,400 dholes.

Solution: 1

There are about 24,000=20,000+4,000 maned wolves. 20,000 is ten times as many as 2,000, and 4,000 is ten times as many as 400. So there are about 2,000+400 or 2,400 dholes estimated to live in the wild.

We can check this:

$$10\times(2000+400)=10\times2,000+10\times400=20,000+4,000=24,000$$

Solution: 2

We can also use a tape diagram to show that the number of maned wolves (24,000) is ten times the number of dholes. The number of dholes must be 2,400 (which a student could then check with multiplication or repeated addition.)

For a student to use this strategy effectively, s/he would have to have some understanding of how to divide 24,000 by 10.

For students struggling to figure out the division, it may help to model the following thought process: "Could one unit be worth 1,000 animals...2,000 animals...3,000 animals?" Understanding that each unit must represent somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 animals would be a likely first step.

From there, the thought process might be: "If we know each unit represents 2,000 animals, then we still need to account for 4,000 more animals. Could one unit contain an additional 100 animals...200 animals...300 animals...400 animals...500 animals?"

Through this reasoning, students could come to the conclusion that each unit must represent 2,400 animals.

-

Arrange these numbers in decreasing order, beginning with the greatest. $$1470 \qquad 847 \qquad 710 \qquad 1047 \qquad 147$$

##
Solution

-

$$420 \qquad 2004 \qquad 2040 \qquad 2400 \qquad 4002$$ We know that 420 is less than any four-digit number. Of the numbers 2004, 2040, and 2400, 2004 is the least, and 2400 is the greatest, since four ones are less than four tens, and four tens are less than four hundreds. 4002 is the greatest number since it contains four thousands, and the other three four-digit numbers contain less than three thousands.

-

$$1470 \qquad 1047 \qquad 847 \qquad 710 \qquad 147$$ We know that 1470 and 1047 are greater than the three three-digit numbers, since 1470 and 1047 are both greater than one thousand, and the three-digit numbers are less than one thousand. 1470 is greater than 1047 because 1470 contains one thousand and four hundreds, while 1047 contains one thousand and less than one hundred. We know that 847 is greater than 710 because 847 contains eight hundreds, and 710 contains less than eight hundreds. 710 is greater than 147 because 710 contains seven hundreds, and 147 contains less than two hundreds.

2,316

5,090

7,784

Round each number to the nearest 1000. Explain how you can tell which thousand each number will round to by looking at the number line.

##
Solution

The numbers are all plotted on the number line below with the small tick marks labelled:

For rounding to the nearest 1000 we first find which two thousands the number lies between and round to the nearer of the two.

85 lies between 0 and 1000. 500 is exactly half way between 0 and 1000, and 85 is between 0 and 500. So 85 is closer to 0 than 1000 on the number line and it rounds down to 0.

940 lies between 0 and 1000. 500 is exactly half way between 0 and 1000, and 940 is between 500 and 1000. So 940 is closer to 1000 than 0 on the number line and it rounds up to 1000.

2,316 lies between 2,000 and 3,000. 2,500 is exactly half way between 2,000 and 3,000, and 2,316 is between 2,000 and 2,500. So 2,316 is closer to 2,000 than 3,000 on the number line and it rounds down to 2,000.

5,090 lies between 5,000 and 6,000. 5,500 is exactly half way between 5,000 and 6,000, and 5,090 is between 5,000 and 5,500. So 5,090 is closer to 5,000 than 6,000 on the number line and it rounds down to 5,000.

7,784 lies between 7,000 and 8,000. 7,500 is exactly half way between 7,000 and 8,000, and 7,784 is between 7,500 and 8,000. So 7,784 is closer to 8,000 than 7,000 on the number line and it rounds up to 8,000.

Task

Subtract. Check your answer by adding. Then write your answer in the box.

##
Solution

Correct if student writes 4176 in the box.

6,547 – 2,371 = 4,176.

In grade 4, students are expected to be fluent with the standard algorithms for finding sums and differences of multi-digit numbers. This is the most reliable way to calculate the difference 6,547 – 2,371. Working from right to left,

- The ones digit will be 7 – 1 = 6.

- The tens digit will be 14 – 7 = 7.

- The hundreds digit will be 4 – 3 = 1.

- The thousands digit will be 6 – 2 = 4.

In this problem, only the answer matters—not how the student calculated it. But if the student takes a long time to carry out the subtraction or the addition, more practice might be helpful.

If the student can subtract 6,547 – 2,371 but doesn’t know what it means to check this answer by adding, then they might not understand how addition and subtraction are related. For example, if a bank vault has \$6,457 and \$2,371 of this money is stolen, then the remaining money would be \$4,176. If the money were put back (\$4,176 + \$2,371), then the total amount of money in the vault would be the original amount, \$6,547.

Task

Jillian says

I know that 20 times 7 is 140 and if I take away 2 sevens that leaves 126. So 126 $\div$ 7 = 18.

- Is Jillian's calculation correct? Explain.

- Draw a picture showing Jillian's reasoning.

- Use Jillian's method to find 222 $\div$ 6.

##
Solution

-

Jillian's reasoning is correct. She has found $20 \times 7 = 140$ and $2 \times 7 = 14$. This means that

\begin{align} 18 \times 7 &= (20 - 2) \times 7 \\ &= (20 \times 7) - (2 \times 7) \\ &= 140 - 14 \\ &= 126. \end{align}

The second equality uses the distributive property. These equations tell us that 126 $\div$ 7 = 18.

-

Jillian's initial idea of dividing 140 by 7 is represented here:

From there, Jillian decomposes the 20 sevens into 18 sevens and 2 sevens:

Lastly, Jillian recognizes that if the area of both rectangles combined would be 140, then she must subtract off the 2 extra sevens she used to get 140:

-

We have $40 \times 6 = 240$ and $3 \times 6 = 18$. So

\begin{align} 37 \times 6 &= (40-3) \times 6 \\ &= (40 \times 6) - (3 \times 6) \\ &= 240 - 18 \\ &= 222. \end{align}

The second line uses the distributive property of multiplication.

- Use the pictures to explain why the two fractions represented above are equivalent.

##
Solution

- $\frac{3}{4}$

- $\frac{9}{12}$

- Three pieces in the bottom rectangle have the same size as 1 piece in the top rectangle. We can even show this by darkening the lines around groups of three small pieces in the rectangle that represents $\frac{9}{12}$:When we make groups of three in the bottom rectangle, there are 3 groups of 3 shaded pieces and 4 groups of 3 in the whole rectangle. Using these groups, we see that

$$ \begin{align} \frac{9}{12} =& \frac{(3 \times 3)}{(4 \times 3)} \\ =& \frac{3}{4} \end{align} $$

of the bottom rectangle is shaded. Since the shaded portion is the same in each case but we just look at it in a different way and describe it with a different fraction, the fractions are equal. So $$\frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}$$

Order the following fractions from smallest to largest: $$ \frac{3}{8}, \; \;\; \; \frac{1}{3}, \; \; \; \; \frac{5}{9}, \; \; \; \; \frac{2}{5} $$ Explain your reasoning.

##
Solutions

Solution: 1 Comparing with benchmark fractions and using common numerators and denominators strategically

The fractions $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$: this can be seen, for example, by doubling the numerator and observing that twice the numerator is less than the denominator in all three cases. For $\frac{5}{9}$, on the other hand, twice $5$ is bigger than $9$ so if this fraction is doubled, it gives more than one and so $\frac{5}{9} > \frac{1}{2}$. This tells us which of the four fractions is largest, so now we focus on comparing the other three.

Looking at $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$, we can see that $$ \frac{3}{9} \lt \frac{3}{8} $$ because 1 eighth of a whole is more than 1 ninth of the same whole, and so 3 eighths must be more than 3 ninths. But we also have $$ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$ so this means that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8}$. This is a valuable piece of information, but it does not help place $\frac{2}{5}$ relative to either $\frac{3}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$. Let's compare each of these fractions individually to $\frac25$.

There is no obvious benchmark fraction to compare $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. However, with only two fractions we can use a common denominator: $8 \times 5 = 40$ is a natural common denominator to use. Each $\frac{1}{8}$ needs to be subdivided into $5$ equal parts to make $\frac{1}{40}$, so $$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3\times 5}{8\times 5} = \frac{15}{40}$$ Each $\frac{1}{5}$ needs to be subdivided into $8$ equal parts to give $\frac{1}{40}$, and $$\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\times 8}{5\times 8} = \frac{16}{40}$$ Since $$\frac{15}{40} \lt \frac{16}{40}$$ this means that $$\frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5}$$ Putting this together with the work above, we have put the four fractions in order of increasing size: $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

Notice that we did not need to compare $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ because our work shows that $\frac{3}{8}$ lies between them. If we had started by comparing $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ we would have found that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{2}{5}$: this would not have told us where $\frac{3}{8}$ lies relative to $\frac{2}{5}$ since both are larger than $\frac{1}{3}$.

Solution: 2 Common Denominator

The denominators for the fractions are $8,3,9,$ and $5$. Since 3 is a factor of 9, $$8 \times 9\times 5 = 360$$ will work as a common denominator. Since $8 \times (9\times 5) = 8 \times 45,$ we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 45 to rewrite $\frac{3}{8}$ with a denominator of $360$: $$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 45}{8 \times 45} = \frac{135}{360}. $$ For the next fraction, $\frac{1}{3}$, we have

\begin{align} 360 &= 8 \times 9 \times 5 \\ &= 8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \\ &= 3 \times 8 \times 3 \times 5. \end{align}

So to get $360$ as a denominator we need to multiply numerator and denominator by $8 \times 3 \times 5 = 120$: $$ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 120}{3 \times 120} = \frac{120}{360}. $$ Proceeding in the same way with $\frac{5}{9}$ we find that the denominator $9$ needs to be multiplied by $8 \times 5 = 40$ to get $360$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $40$ gives $$ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 40}{9 \times 40} = \frac{200}{360}. $$ Finally for $\frac{2}{5}$, to get $360$ in the denominator we need to multiply by $8 \times 9 = 72$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $72$ gives $$ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 72}{5 \times 72} = \frac{144}{360}. $$

Now that we have a common denominator of $360$ the size of the fractions can be compared by looking at the size of the numerators. We have $$ \frac{120}{360} \lt \frac{135}{360} \lt \frac{144}{360} \lt \frac{200}{360} $$ because these fractions represent different numbers of equally sized parts, with $360$ of these parts in a whole. Remembering the equivalences of fractions shown above, we conclude that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}$.

Solution: 3 Common Numerator

The numerators of these fractions, $3,1,5$, and $2$, are simpler than the denominators and so finding a common numerator is a good strategy for comparing their size. Since $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$ we can use $30$ as a common numerator. We can then rewrite each of these fractions with $30$ as a numerator. This will mean multiplying numerator and denominator of each fraction by the appropriate number: $10$ for $\frac{3}{8}$, $30$ for $\frac{1}{3}$, $6$ for $\frac{5}{9}$, and $15$ for $\frac{2}{5}$:

\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &= \frac{3 \times 10}{8 \times 10} = \frac{30}{80}\\ \frac{1}{3} & = \frac{1 \times 30}{3 \times 30} = \frac{30}{90}\\ \frac{5}{9} &= \frac{5 \times 6}{9 \times 6} = \frac{30}{54}\\ \frac{2}{5} &= \frac{2 \times 15}{5 \times 15} = \frac{30}{75}. \end{align}

The more equal sized pieces a whole is broken into, the smaller those pieces will be. So, ordering the unit fractions from least to greatest, we have $$ \frac{1}{90} \lt \frac{1}{80} \lt \frac{1}{75} \lt \frac{1}{54}. $$ Hence we can conclude that $$ \frac{30}{90} \lt \frac{30}{80} \lt \frac{30}{75} \lt \frac{30}{54} $$ and so $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

One variation on this theme would be to observe, as in the second solution, that $\frac{5}{9}$ is the largest of the four fractions because it is larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ while the other three are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$. This makes the rest of the ordering a little easier because now, looking at $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{3}{8}$, we could employ the same method with a smaller common numerator, namely $6$. Concretely,

\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &= \frac{3 \times 2}{8 \times 2} = \frac{6}{16}\\ \frac{1}{3} & = \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18}\\ \frac{2}{5} &= \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}. \end{align}

Reasoning as above, we see that $\frac{6}{18} \lt \frac{6}{16} \lt \frac{6}{15}$ and so once more we find that $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

Solutions

Solution: 1 Comparing with benchmark fractions and using common numerators and denominators strategically

The fractions $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, and $\frac{2}{5}$ are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$: this can be seen, for example, by doubling the numerator and observing that twice the numerator is less than the denominator in all three cases. For $\frac{5}{9}$, on the other hand, twice $5$ is bigger than $9$ so if this fraction is doubled, it gives more than one and so $\frac{5}{9} > \frac{1}{2}$. This tells us which of the four fractions is largest, so now we focus on comparing the other three.

Looking at $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$, we can see that $$ \frac{3}{9} \lt \frac{3}{8} $$ because 1 eighth of a whole is more than 1 ninth of the same whole, and so 3 eighths must be more than 3 ninths. But we also have $$ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$ so this means that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8}$. This is a valuable piece of information, but it does not help place $\frac{2}{5}$ relative to either $\frac{3}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$. Let's compare each of these fractions individually to $\frac25$.

There is no obvious benchmark fraction to compare $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$. However, with only two fractions we can use a common denominator: $8 \times 5 = 40$ is a natural common denominator to use. Each $\frac{1}{8}$ needs to be subdivided into $5$ equal parts to make $\frac{1}{40}$, so $$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3\times 5}{8\times 5} = \frac{15}{40}$$ Each $\frac{1}{5}$ needs to be subdivided into $8$ equal parts to give $\frac{1}{40}$, and $$\frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\times 8}{5\times 8} = \frac{16}{40}$$ Since $$\frac{15}{40} \lt \frac{16}{40}$$ this means that $$\frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5}$$ Putting this together with the work above, we have put the four fractions in order of increasing size: $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

Notice that we did not need to compare $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{5}$ because our work shows that $\frac{3}{8}$ lies between them. If we had started by comparing $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ we would have found that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{2}{5}$: this would not have told us where $\frac{3}{8}$ lies relative to $\frac{2}{5}$ since both are larger than $\frac{1}{3}$.

Solution: 2 Common Denominator

The denominators for the fractions are $8,3,9,$ and $5$. Since 3 is a factor of 9, $$8 \times 9\times 5 = 360$$ will work as a common denominator. Since $8 \times (9\times 5) = 8 \times 45,$ we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 45 to rewrite $\frac{3}{8}$ with a denominator of $360$: $$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 45}{8 \times 45} = \frac{135}{360}. $$ For the next fraction, $\frac{1}{3}$, we have

\begin{align} 360 &= 8 \times 9 \times 5 \\ &= 8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \\ &= 3 \times 8 \times 3 \times 5. \end{align}

So to get $360$ as a denominator we need to multiply numerator and denominator by $8 \times 3 \times 5 = 120$: $$ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 120}{3 \times 120} = \frac{120}{360}. $$ Proceeding in the same way with $\frac{5}{9}$ we find that the denominator $9$ needs to be multiplied by $8 \times 5 = 40$ to get $360$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $40$ gives $$ \frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 40}{9 \times 40} = \frac{200}{360}. $$ Finally for $\frac{2}{5}$, to get $360$ in the denominator we need to multiply by $8 \times 9 = 72$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $72$ gives $$ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 72}{5 \times 72} = \frac{144}{360}. $$

Now that we have a common denominator of $360$ the size of the fractions can be compared by looking at the size of the numerators. We have $$ \frac{120}{360} \lt \frac{135}{360} \lt \frac{144}{360} \lt \frac{200}{360} $$ because these fractions represent different numbers of equally sized parts, with $360$ of these parts in a whole. Remembering the equivalences of fractions shown above, we conclude that $\frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}$.

Solution: 3 Common Numerator

The numerators of these fractions, $3,1,5$, and $2$, are simpler than the denominators and so finding a common numerator is a good strategy for comparing their size. Since $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$ we can use $30$ as a common numerator. We can then rewrite each of these fractions with $30$ as a numerator. This will mean multiplying numerator and denominator of each fraction by the appropriate number: $10$ for $\frac{3}{8}$, $30$ for $\frac{1}{3}$, $6$ for $\frac{5}{9}$, and $15$ for $\frac{2}{5}$:

\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &= \frac{3 \times 10}{8 \times 10} = \frac{30}{80}\\ \frac{1}{3} & = \frac{1 \times 30}{3 \times 30} = \frac{30}{90}\\ \frac{5}{9} &= \frac{5 \times 6}{9 \times 6} = \frac{30}{54}\\ \frac{2}{5} &= \frac{2 \times 15}{5 \times 15} = \frac{30}{75}. \end{align}

The more equal sized pieces a whole is broken into, the smaller those pieces will be. So, ordering the unit fractions from least to greatest, we have $$ \frac{1}{90} \lt \frac{1}{80} \lt \frac{1}{75} \lt \frac{1}{54}. $$ Hence we can conclude that $$ \frac{30}{90} \lt \frac{30}{80} \lt \frac{30}{75} \lt \frac{30}{54} $$ and so $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

One variation on this theme would be to observe, as in the second solution, that $\frac{5}{9}$ is the largest of the four fractions because it is larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ while the other three are all less than $\frac{1}{2}$. This makes the rest of the ordering a little easier because now, looking at $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{5}$, and $\frac{3}{8}$, we could employ the same method with a smaller common numerator, namely $6$. Concretely,

\begin{align} \frac{3}{8} &= \frac{3 \times 2}{8 \times 2} = \frac{6}{16}\\ \frac{1}{3} & = \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18}\\ \frac{2}{5} &= \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}. \end{align}

Reasoning as above, we see that $\frac{6}{18} \lt \frac{6}{16} \lt \frac{6}{15}$ and so once more we find that $$ \frac{1}{3} \lt \frac{3}{8} \lt \frac{2}{5} \lt \frac{5}{9}. $$

- Write a story problem that can be solved by finding \(5\times4\).

- Draw two different diagrams that show that \(5\times4=20\). Explain how your diagrams represent \(5\times4=20\).

- Which of the diagrams you used to represent \(5\times4=20\) can be used to represent \(5\times\frac{2}{3}\)? Draw the diagram if possible.

##
Solution

Part 1.

The student may create a context that uses the “groups of” representation, for example saying that there are five bags, and each bag has 4 apples. Together, there are 20 apples if you combine all of the five bags. Depending on the representations they choose, the student might also say that finding the area of a rectangle with side lengths 4 units and 5 units would be an appropriate context. Students may write a multiplicative comparison problem; for example, “Suzy has 4 lollipops and Lily has 5 times as many lollipops.”

Part 2.

Students might draw diagrams based on sets, length (such as a number line or bar diagrams) or area that represent equal groups. They also might draw a multiplicative comparison diagram. See examples below.

-

The first diagram shows 5 groups of 4, which totals 20.

-

The second diagram shows 5 rectangles of length 4 put end to end, which has a total length of 20.

-

The third diagram shows a rectangle with side lengths 5 and 4 and area 20.

- The fourth diagram shows two rectangles; one is of length 4 and the other is 5 times as long with a total length of 20.

Part 3.

All of diagrams can be adapted; see below.

4.OA Thousands and Millions of Fourth Graders

##
Task

There are almost 40 thousand fourth graders in Mississippi and almost 400 thousand fourth graders in Texas. There are almost 4 million fourth graders in the United States.

We write 4 million as 4,000,000. How many times more fourth graders are there in Texas than in Mississippi? How many times more fourth graders are there in the United States than in Texas? Use the approximate populations listed above to solve.

There are about 4 thousand fourth graders in Washington, D.C. How many times more fourth graders are there in the United States than in Washington, D.C.?

##
Solution

​We write 4 thousand as 4,000

We write 40 thousand as 40,000

We write 400 thousand as 400,000

The value of each place is ten times the value of the place immediately to the right.

So:

40,000 is 10 times 4,000

400,000 is 10 times 40,000.

4,000,000 is 10 times 400,000.

Thus, 400,000 = 10 $\times$ 40,000, and there are about 10 times as many fourth graders in Texas as there are in Mississippi.

Also, 4,000,000 = 10 $\times$ 400,000, and there are about 10 times as many fourth graders in the US as there are in Texas.

Finally, to go from 4,000 to 4,000,000, we have to multiply by 10 three times. We see that $$10\times10\times10=10\times100=1000$$ So there are about 1,000 times as many fourth graders in the US as there are in Washington DC.

- What would Hallie's allowance need to be in 2012 in order for her to be able to buy as many carnival tickets as she could in 2008?

- What happens to your ability to buy things if prices increase and your allowance doesn’t increase?

##
Solution

- If she has \$9 and tickets cost \$2 each, we divide 9 by 2 to find out how many tickets she has (this is a "How many groups?" division problem). $$9 ÷ 2 = 4 \text{, with a remainder of }1$$ So she could buy 4 carnival tickets with one month's allowance in 2008 and would have \$1.00 left over.

- As before, we divide to find how many tickets she can buy. 9 ÷ 4 = 2 with a remainder of 1. So if her allowance was \$9.00 in 2012, she could only buy 2 tickets with one month's allowance.

- Her allowance was \$9.00 and now it is \$14.00, and $$14 - 9 = 5$$ so her allowance increased by \$5.00.

- Since Tickets cost \$4 in 2012 and they cost \$2.00 in 2008, and $$4 - 2 = 2$$ a carnival ticket cost \$2.00 more in 2012 than it did in 2008.

- We will divide as we did in parts (a) and (b) $$14 \div 4 = 3 \text{, with a remainder of }2$$ So she could buy 3 carnival tickets with one month's allowance in 2012 and would have \$2.00 left over. Even though her allowance went up, the number of tickets she could buy went down.

- Since carnival tickets cost \$4.00 in 2012 and she could buy 4 tickets in 2008 , and 4 × 4 = 16, her allowance in 2012 would need to be at least \$16.

- You can buy fewer things if prices increase but your allowance doesn’t increase.

4.OA The Locker Game

##
Task

The 20 students in Mr. Wolf's 4th grade class are playing a game in a hallway that is lined with 20 lockers in a row.

- The first student starts with the first locker and goes down the hallway and opens all the lockers.

- The second student starts with the second locker and goes down the hallway and shuts every other locker.

- The third student stops at every third locker and opens the locker if it is closed or closes the locker if it is open.

- The fourth student stops at every fourth locker and opens the locker if it is closed or closes the locker if it is open.

This process continues until all 20 students in the class have passed through the hallway.

- Which lockers are still open at the end of the game? Explain your reasoning.

- Which lockers were touched by only two students? Explain your reasoning.

- Which lockers were touched by only three students? Explain your reasoning.

- Which lockers were touched the most?

##
Solution

-

The lockers that are still open are perfect squares, specifically $1\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$, and $4\times 4$. To see why this is true, first note that:

- The 1st student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 1.

- The 2nd student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 2.

- The 3rd student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 3.

- The 4th student changes all the lockers with a locker number that is a multiple of 4.

and so on. So a locker is touched by a student if that student's number is a factor of that locker's number.

Now consider the factors of 16 which are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. This means the 16th locker was opened by the 1st student, then it was closed by the 2nd student, then it was opened by the 4th student, then it was closed by the second 8th student, and then opened one last time by the 16th student. Now note that the square numbers are the only numbers with an odd number of factors (all other numbers have factors which come in pairs.) Since an odd number of factors means the locker will be changed an odd number of times, it must be open at the end.

With only 20 lockers, students can simply observe this fact about the number of factors to be true for the numbers 1 to 20, which gives practice with finding factors of whole numbers. The explanation for why this is always true goes a bit beyond 4th grade.

- The lockers that were touched by only two students are the prime numbers (since prime numbers only have two factors.) In our case they are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.

- The lockers which are touched by only three students are the squares of prime numbers (because these are the only numbers which have three factors.) In our case they are 4 and 9. (For example, 4 has three factors: 1, 2, and 4)

- The lockers which are touched the most are those lockers whose number has the most factors. In our case 12, 18, and 20 all have 6 factors, so they were each touched 6 times. $$ 12 = 1\times 12 = 2\times 6 = 3\times 4$$ $$ 18 = 1\times 18 = 2\times 9 = 3\times 6$$ $$ 20 = 1\times 20 = 2\times 10 = 4\times 5$$

There are several patterns that students might see. For example, they might notice that the result increases by two when the number increases by one. Hopefully, some students will notice that all the numbers they entered are odd.

-

Sherri noticed that all the numbers she entered are odd.

-

An even number multiplied by 2 result in an even number, because multiplying by 2 will double the number of objects. As a result, if your objects are paired off, every object will have a partner.

Example: We can represent six multiplied by 2 as 2 rows with six circles in each row:

As you can see, every circle has a partner.

-

An odd number multiplied by 2 result in an even number, because multiplying by 2 will double the number of objects. As a result, if your objects are paired off, every object will have a partner.

Example: We can represent seven multiplied by 2 as 2 rows with seven circles in each row:

-

An even number plus 1 is odd, because an even number of objects can be paired off but adding only one more object will mean that the last object added will not have a partner: there will be one left over when you try to pair them off.

Example: If we represent 12 (an even number) as two rows of six circles, and add one more circle, we can see it must be odd:

-

An odd number plus 1 is even, because when you have an odd number of objects and try to pair them off, one will always be left over. If you add one more object, then the lone object gains a partner, and all the objects will be in pairs.

Example: If we represent 13 (an odd number) as two rows of six circles and one lonely circle, and then add one more circle, we can see the “extra” circle now has a partner:

-

The values in the right column are all odd because multiplying an even or an odd number by 2 always results in an even number. An even number plus 1 will always result in an odd number, as shown above.

5.G Battle Ship Using Grid Paper

##
Task

###
Materials

The students will need grid paper and colored pencils; some color for the ships and (for example) red for explosions on their ships and their enemy’s ships. This is how they will keep track of what ordered pairs have been called.

###
Setup

Students begin by folding the grid paper in half. They need to draw coordinate axes on both the top half and the bottom half and label the $x$ and $y$ axes with the numbers 1–10 on each axis. The students will need to draw in 5 ships on ordered pairs and label the ordered pairs. They should draw:

- Two ships that are sitting on 2 ordered pairs,

- One ship that is sitting on 3 ordered pairs,

- One ship that is sitting on 4 ordered pairs, and

- One ship sitting on 5 ordered pairs.

Remind them the bottom half has their boats or (Navy) and the top half has their opponent’s boats.

###
Actions

Students play in pairs sitting opposite each other and take turns calling out ordered pairs. Players should keep a list of the ordered pairs they call out written in $(x,y)$ form on a piece of paper that both players can see so there is no disagreement later on about what has been called (it is common for students to transpose the coordinates). Then they are to mark the ordered pair they call out on the top coordinate plane. They should mark in black if they missed and red if they hit their opponent’s boat. On the bottom half of the grid paper they are to color black for the ordered pairs their opponent calls out and color red for the ordered pairs that hit their ship.

##
Solution

The students will be able to demonstrate understanding of ordered pairs by playing this game. The teacher can assess the students’ understanding through listening, watching, and checking the students’ work as they play with a partner. The partners will also make sure the other student is not cheating because you can reward the winner with a prize.

5.G Meerkat Coordinate Plane Task

##
Task

Greetings from the Kalahari Desert in South Africa! In this activity, you will learn a lot about the Kalahari’s most playful residents: meerkats.

- The following ordered pairs show the height of a typical meerkat at different times during the first 20 months of life. Graph the corresponding points and see what you can discover about meerkats. Once you have graphed them all, connect the points in the order they are given to form a line graph.

- What does the point (0 months, 3 inches) mean for a typical meerkat's height?

- How tall do you think a typical meerkat gets? Why?

- At what age do meerkats reach their full height? How do you know from this graph?

- If this graph were about a human instead of a meerkat, at what age do you think the height would stop getting larger?

##
Solution

-

- The point (0 inches, 3 months) means that when a meerkat is first born, it is typically 3 inches in height.

- The graph shows that meerkats grow to about 12 inches tall because none of the points given has a $y$ value greater than 12. It looks like the meerkat has stopped growing.

- Meerkats stop growing at about 14 months old. At that point, time continues to pass, but meerkats stay about 12 inches tall.

- Answers may vary, but most students will predict that humans usually stop growing at about 17 years old.

Here is an example when a rhombus is a square:

Here is an example when a rhombus isnota square:

2. A triangle is a parallelogram.

This isnevertrue. A triangle is a three-sided figure. A parallelogram is a four-sided figure with two sets of parallel sides.

3. A square is a parallelogram.

This isalwaystrue. Squares are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides and 4 right angles, and they also have two sets of parallel sides. Parallelograms are quadrilaterals with two sets of parallel sides. Since squares must be quadrilaterals with two sets of parallel sides, then all squares are parallelograms.

4. A square is a rhombus

This isalwaystrue. Squares are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides. Since rhombuses are quadrilaterals with 4 congruent sides, squares are by definition also rhombuses.

The picture below is called a Venn Diagram. Each circle (A, B, and C) contain shapes that all share at least one characteristic. Some shapes are contained in more than one circle because they share more than one characteristic. For example, shape 3 fits the rule for circles A and B, but not circle C. It lies within circles A and B, but not circle C.

- What are the characteristics shared by shapes within circle A? Within circle B? Within circle C? Double check to make sure that any shapes that have that characteristic are contained within the circle and any shapes that don't lie outside of the circle.

Characteristics of all shapes contained in Circle A:

Characteristics of all shapes contained in Circle B:

Characteristics of all shapes contained in Circle C:

b. Where would you place a rectangle that does not have four sides of the same length? Why?

##
Solution

- All shapes in circle A are triangles. All shapes in circle B have a right angle. All shapes in circle C have equal side-lengths.

- The rectangle without 4 equal side lengths must be placed in the circle for shapes with right angles. Since it does not have 4 sides with equal length and is not a triangle, it must not be in the overlapping section of other circles.

5.MD Minutes and Days

##
Task

What time was it 2011 minutes after the beginning of January 1, 2011?

##
Solution

January 1, 2011 begins at 12:00 AM. To find the time 2011 minutes later will require changing units since time is told in hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour so to see how many hours there are in 2011 minutes we can perform the division problem $2011 \div 60$. Since $30 \times 60 = 1800$, we can write $$ 2011 = 30 \times 60 + 211. $$ Next, there are three groups of $60$ in $211$, with a remainder of 31 so we get $$ 2011 = 30 \times 60 + 3 \times 60 + 31. $$ Using the distributive property this last expression is equivalent to $$ 2011 = (30 + 3) \times 60 + 31. $$ So 2011 minutes is the same as 33 hours and 31 minutes. Now 33 hours is one day and an additional 9 hours so this means that 2011 minutes is one day, nine hours, and thirty-one minutes. So 2011 minutes after the beginning of 2011 it is January 2 and it is 9:31 AM.

You and your partner will need fraction cards made from this set:

-

Label the line-plot below with $\frac18$'s. Cut out and divide the cards evenly between the two players, laying them face-down. Each partner will choose one of their face-down cards and turn it over. The team will then add their fractions together. For each turn, each team will record their sum on the line plot.

Each team should have 12 data points marked on their line plot.

- Look at the line plot. Which values came up the most? Which values did not come up?

- The tick marks on the number line correspond to eighths. Which of the eighths will never come up as a sum of two of these cards? Why?

- You want to improve the game so that it is possible for two fractions to sum to $\frac{7}{8}$. Name one fraction card that you could add to the deck and explain why your new card would now make it possible to have $\frac{7}{8}$ as a sum of two cards.

Before discussing the individual solutions, it is helpful to think about the possible outcomes in this task.

Card 1Card 2Sum

$\frac18$$\frac14$$\frac38$

$\frac14$$\frac18$$\frac38$

$\frac14$$\frac14$$\frac48$

$\frac14$$\frac12$$\frac68$

$\frac12$$\frac14$$\frac68$

$\frac12$$\frac12$$\frac88$

There should be 12 “x”s marked on the line plot and these “x”s should only be above the values $\frac{2}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{4}{8}. \frac{5}{8}, \frac{6}{8}$ or 1. One possible example is shown below:

-

Answers may vary, but in the example line plot above, $\frac{3}{8}$, came up most frequently and 0, $\frac18$, $\frac68$, and $\frac78$ did not come up. Fifth grade students are not expected to work on concepts of probability. The purpose of this question is to prime students to think about which answers cannot come up at all rather than to explain why some possible sums are more likely than others.

-

The values that cannot come up are 0, $\frac{1}{8}$ and $\frac{7}{8}$ because none of the combinations of the cards will sum to these values, as we saw above.

Students might also note that 0 and $\frac{1}{8}$ are both less than or equal to one of the addends. Since 5th graders have not yet worked with negative numbers, they could not start with $\frac{1}{8}$ and add a non-zero value and end with a sum less than or equal to $\frac{1}{8}$ (and none of the cards have negative numbers).

There are 3 possibilities for new cards, $\frac34$, $\frac58$, or $\frac38$:

$$ \begin{align} \frac18+\frac34 &=\frac78\\ \frac14+\frac58 &=\frac78\\ \frac12+\frac38 &=\frac78\\ \end{align} $$

Students should be able to show how they found the sums above.

5.MD Cari's Aquarium

##
Task

Cari is the lead architect for the city’s new aquarium. All of the tanks in the aquarium will be rectangular prisms where the side lengths are whole numbers.

-

Cari’s first tank is 4 feet wide, 8 feet long and 5 feet high. How many cubic feet of water can her tank hold?

- Cari knows that a certain species of fish needs at least 240 cubic feet of water in their tank. Create 3 separate tanks that hold exactly 240 cubic feet of water. (Ex: She could design a tank that is 10 feet wide, 4 feet long and 6 feet in height.)

- In the back of the aquarium, Cari realizes that the ceiling is only 10 feet high. She needs to create a tank that can hold exactly 100 cubic feet of water. Name one way that she could build a tank that is not taller than 10 feet.

##
Solution

-

The tank can hold 160 cubic feet of water because:

\begin{align} \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} &= \text{Volume} \\ 8\text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} &= 160 \text{ feet}^3 \end{align}

Alternatively, the base of the tank is:

$$ 4 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet}^2 $$

Therefore,

\begin{align} \text{Area of Base} \times \text{Height} &= \text{Volume} \\ 32 \text{ feet}^2 \times 5 \text{ feet} &= 160 \text{ feet}^3 \end{align}

-

There are many possible solutions to this task. The whole number factor combinations are listed below. Please note that each set of factors is listed only once, though a student could reassign which factor represents length, width or height as long as she or he uses the same three factors.

10 ft.6 ft.4 ft.240 ft3

10 ft.8 ft.3 ft.240 ft3

8 ft.6 ft.5 ft.240 ft3

Again, the teacher should prompt students to think about what their tank would look like in real-life. A tank that is 40 feet long, 3 feet wide and 2 feet high would be very long, skinny and short. This tank would not be good for bigger fish, but it could be useful to watch something small that does not need a lot of space to move, such as a turtle.

-

There are many possible solutions to this task. All whole number factor combinations are listed below to ensure that students understand that they cannot simply choose any three factors that multiply to 100 ft.3without considering the restrictions on height. Make sure that students think through the real-world implications of this problem: Cari’s tank would work as long as it not higher than 10 feet tall.

Jossie drew a picture to represent 0.24:

She said,

The little squares represent tenths and the rectangles represent hundredths, which makes sense because ten little squares makes one rectangle, and ten times ten is one hundred.

-

Explain what is wrong with Jossie's reasoning.

-

Name three numbers that Jossie's picture could represent. In each case, What does a little square represent? What does a rectangle represent?

##
Solution

- Jossie is right that ten times ten is one hundred, but ten timesone tenthis one: $$10\times 0.1 = 1$$ Since hundredths are smaller than tenths, her picture should reflect that. She could draw 2 rectangles and 4 little squares to represent 0.24.

- If the little square represents 1, then the rectangle will represent 10 and the picture will represent 42.

If the little square represents 0.1, then the rectangle will represent 1 and the picture will represent 4.2.

If the little square represents 0.01, then the rectangle will represent 0.1 and the picture will represent 0.42.

5.NBT Marta's Multiplication Error

##
Task

Marta made an error while finding the product $84.15 \times 10$.In your own words, explain Marta’s misunderstanding. Please explain what she should do to get the correct answer and include the correct answer in your response.

##
Solution

Marta is mistakenly trying to continue a pattern dealing with multiplying whole numbers by powers of 10: the product will have the same digits as the whole number followed by the same number of 0s as the power of 10. Marta tried to place a 0 after 84.15 in her problem to continue this pattern, but placing a 0 in the thousandths place did not change the value of 84.15. Instead, Marta can shift the decimal one place to the right so that each digit occupies ten times its original place. Her correct answer is 841.5. Another way of finding the product of 84.15 and 10 is to rewrite 84.15 in expanded notation and use the distributive property:

$$\begin{align} (80 + 4 + 0.1 + 0.05) \times 10 &= (80 \times 10) + (4 \times 10) + (0.1 \times 10) +(0.05 \times 10) \\ &= 800 + 40 + 1 + 0.5\\ &= 841.5 \end{align}$$

Using expanded notation also highlights that the place value of each digit needs to be multiplied by a factor of 10. It should be noted that the digit 8 in the original expression represented 8 tens, but will be 8 hundreds in our product. In Marta’s solution, the 8 still only represents 8 tens and the magnitude of the number has not changed.

##
Solution

- Nine and fifty two tenths is not equivalent to 9.52. Here is one way to show that these expressions are not equivalent. Let's write out "nine and fifty two tenths" as 9 wholes and 52 tenths.

$$ \begin{align} 9+\frac{52}{10}&=\\ 9+\frac{50}{10}+\frac{2}{10}&=\\ 9+5+\frac{2}{10}&=14\frac{2}{10} \end{align} $$

- 9 + 0.5 + 0.02 and 9.52 are equivalent. 9 + 0.5 + 0.02 shows one of the methods of writing 9.52 in expanded form.

- 9 ones + 5 tenths + 2 hundredths is equivalent to 9.52. "9 ones + 5 tenths + 2 hundredths" shows the value of each digit in the number 9.52.

- The expression $$(9\times1)+(5\times\frac{1}{10})+(2\times\frac{1}{100})$$ is equivalent to 9.52. It is another representation of 9.52 in expanded form, showing explicitly the value of each digit in the number 9.52.

- 952 tenths is not equivalent to 9.52. We can show this by writing 952 tenths as a fraction and then as a mixed number.

$$ \begin{align} \frac{952}{10}&=\\ \frac{950}{10}+\frac{2}{10}&=95\frac{2}{10} \end{align} $$

The value of 952 tenths is actually 95.2 (ten times the value of 9.52).

- 952 hundredths is equivalent to 9.52. We can show this by writing 952 hundredths as a fraction and then as a mixed number:

$$ \begin{align} \frac{952}{100}&=\\ \frac{900}{100}+\frac{52}{100}&=\\ 9+\frac{52}{100}&=9.52 \end{align} $$

##
Task

A number $n$ is shown on the number line.1. The tick marks are evenly spaced. Label them. 2. What is $n$ rounded to the nearest hundredth? 3. What is $n$ rounded to the nearest tenth?

##
Solution

First, label all of the tick marks:

We can see that $n$ is closer to 0.04 than 0.03, so it rounds up to 0.04.

We can also see that $n$ is closer to 0 than to 0.1, so $n$ rounds down to 0.

Division Accuracy

Task

Divide. Check your answer by multiplying. Then write your answer in the box.

##
Solution

Correct if student writes the number 263.

Divide: 8,153 ÷ 31 = 263

Check: 263 × 31 = 8,153

In this problem, only the answer matters—not how the student calculated it. But if the student takes quite a long time to carry out the division or the multiplication, more practice might be helpful.

If the student can divide 8,153 ÷ 31 but doesn’t know what it means to check this answer by multiplying, then they might not understand how multiplication and division are related. For example, if we imagine that a fifth-grade class raised $8,153 for a summer field trip, to be shared equally among 31 students, then each student’s share can be calculated by dividing: 8,153 ÷ 31 = 263. And if we multiply one student’s share by 31, we should end up with the original amount: 31 × 263 = 8,153.

5.NBT The Value of Education

##
Task

The table shows four people who earn the typical amount for their education level.

NameLevel of EducationWeekly Income

MileyHigh School Dropout\$440.50

NikoHigh School Graduate\$650.35

Taylor2-Year College Graduate\$771.25

Pinky4-Year College Graduate\$1,099.20

- How much more does Niko earn than Miley in one week?

- If Taylor and Miley both work for 2 weeks, how much more will Taylor earn?

- How much money will Pinky earn in a month? About how long will Miley have to work to earn the same amount?

##
Solution

- Niko makes \$650.35 per week and Miley makes \$440.50 per week. We know that $$650-440=210$$

and $$210.35-0.50 = 210+0.35-0.50 = 210-0.15 = 209.85$$

So Niko makes \$209.85 more per week than Miley.

- Taylor makes \$771.25 per week and makes twice that much in two weeks.

$$2\times 771.25 = 2(700+70+1 +0.25)=1400 + 140 + 2 + 0.50$$

So Taylor makes \$1542.50 in two weeks.

Miley makes \$440.50 per week and so will make \$881 in two weeks. Since

$$1542.50-881 = 742.50-81 = 741.50-80 = 701.50 - 40 = 661.50$$

We know that Taylor will make \$661.50 more than Miley in two weeks.

- There are four weeks in a month. Pinky makes \$1099.20 in a week so will make

$$4 \times 1099.20 = 4\times 1100 - 4 \times 0.80 = 4400 - 3.20 = 4396.80$$

So Pinky will make \$4396.80 in a month. We can divide this by how much Miley makes in one week to find out how many weeks she will have to work.

$$4396.8 \div 440.5 \approx 4400 \div 440 = 10$$

So Miley will have to work about 10 weeks, or two and a half months, to earn the same amount that Pinky will make in one month.

Students can also calculate a more exact answer to this question if they need some practice dividing decimals.

5.NF Finding Common Denominators to Add

##
Task

- To add fractions, we usually first find a common denominator.

- Find two different common denominators for $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$.

- Use each common denominator to find the value of $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}$. Draw a picture that shows your solution.

- Find $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$. Draw a picture that shows your solution.

- Find $\frac{14}{8}+\frac{15}{12}$.

##
Solutions

Solution: Adding fractions

-

-

The denominators of the fractions in the first problem are 5 and 15. 5 divides evenly into 15, meaning that 15 is a multiple of 5, so 15 itself is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$. The picture below shows this:

Here is a picture showing the fractions when they are both written in terms of fifteenths.

Any multiple of 15 is also a common multiple of 5 and 15. This means that $2\times15=30$ is a common multiple and is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$. Thus, 15 and 30 are two different common denominators for the fractions $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$.

-

The first common denominator that we identified in part (i) was 15. Here is a picture that represents $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}$:

This is how we can write the process of finding this common denominator and adding using symbols:

$$\begin{align} \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}&=\frac{1\times3}{5\times3}+\frac{1}{15}\\ &=\frac{3}{15}+\frac{1}{15}\\ &=\frac{3+1}{15}\\ &=\frac{4}{15} \end{align}$$

The picture shows that after we convert $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{3}{15}$ we can add $\frac{1}{15}$ and we are left with $\frac{4}{15}$, as we found symbolically.

The second common denominator that we identified in part (i) was 30. Here is a picture that represents $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}$:

This is how we can write the process of finding this common denominator and adding using symbols:

$$\begin{align} \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}&=\frac{1\times6}{5\times6}+\frac{1\times2}{15\times2}\\ &=\frac{6}{30}+\frac{2}{30}\\ &=\frac{6+2}{30}\\ &=\frac{8}{30}\\ &=\frac{4\times2}{15\times2}\\ &=\frac{4}{15}\\ \end{align}$$

The picture shows that after we convert $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{6}{30}$ and $\frac{1}{15}$ to $\frac{2}{30}$ we can add the thirtieths and are left with $\frac{8}{30}$. This solution is equivalent to $\frac{4\times 2}{15\times 2}\frac{4}{15}$, as we found above. Thus, we get the same answer using the two different common denominators that we identified in part (i), as we would expect.

-

In order to find the solution to the addition problem $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$, we can first find a common denominator. 20 is a multiple of 4 and 5 because $4\times5=20$, meaning that 20 is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$. Here is a picture that shows these fractions when they are both written in terms of twentieths:

Here is a picture that represents $\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$:

This is how we can write the process of finding a common denominator and adding using symbols:

$$\begin{align} \frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{5} &=\frac{3\times5}{4\times5}+\frac{1\times4}{5\times4}\\ &=\frac{15}{20}+\frac{4}{20}\\ &=\frac{15+4}{20}\\ &=\frac{19}{20} \end{align}$$

The picture shows that when we convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to $\frac{15}{20}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{4}{20}$ and add twentieths, we have $\frac{19}{20}$, as we found symbolically.

- In order to solve this addition problem we again find a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{14}{8}$ and $\frac{15}{12}$. 24 is a common multiple for the denominators 8 and 12 because $8\times3=24$ and $12\times2=24$. This means that 24 is a common denominator for the fractions $\frac{14}{8}$ and $\frac{15}{12}$. This is how we can write the process of finding a common denominator and adding using symbols:

$$\begin{align} \frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12} &=\frac{14\times3}{8\times3}+\frac{5\times2}{12\times2}\\ &=\frac{42}{24}+\frac{10}{24}\\ &=\frac{52}{24} \end{align}$$ If we pause for a moment, we will see that $\frac{52}{24}$ is equivalent to $\frac{13}{6}$, although either representation of the sum is correct.

Solution: Alternative approach to part (c)

A student with a robust understanding of fraction equivalence might note that $\frac{14}{8}$ is equivalent to $\frac{7\times 2}{4\times 2}=\frac74$. So:

$$\frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac74+\frac{5}{12}$$

12 is a common denominator for these two fractions, so:

$$\begin{align} \frac{14}{8}+\frac{5}{12} &=\frac74+\frac{5}{12}\\ &=\frac{7\times3}{4\times3}+\frac{5}{12}\\ &=\frac{21}{12}+\frac{5}{12}\\ &=\frac{26}{12} \end{align}$$

Note that $\frac{26}{12}$ is equivalent to $\frac{52}{24}$ as well as $\frac{13}{6}$; any of these answers are acceptable.

-

Wesley ran $\frac25$ of a mile on Monday and $\frac{3}{10}$ of a mile on Tuesday. How far did he run those two days?

##
Solution

-

In the problem the two fractions refer to the same whole (namely the 40 acres of land). Adding the fractions is appropriate since none of the land is planted with both crops. We add and get the answer of $\frac{7}{10}$ of the 40 acres is planted in wheat or corn.

-

In this problem there are several aspects that make the addition of fractions wrong. First, the fractions given are of different bottles and they don't need to have any relationship to one another. Second, the question asked how much water they drank and no information is given about the amount of water in either bottle, only the fraction of what was in each bottle.

-

In this problem, the two fractions are both parts of the same whole (the number of eggs in the incubator) and could be added together to find the fraction of the eggs that hatched in all. However, since the question asks for the number of eggs hatched, it cannot be answered without more information. Adding the fractions might be part of the solution to the question of how many eggs hatched.

-

In this problem, the two fractions are related to the same whole, namely the total number of members of the team. Since no one arrived after 7:10, then the question can be answered by adding the two fractions to determine that $\frac{7}{10}$ of the team arrived.

-

This problem may serve as a preview to a sixth grade standard relating to ratios. While Andy made $\frac{2}{5}$ of his free throws and Jose made $\frac{3}{10}$ of his free throws, the fractions are of a different number of throws and thus cannot be added. For this problem, the total fraction of free throws is the sum of the number completed out the total number attempted. Thus the total is 5 out of 15 or $\frac{5}{15}$ of the total throws.

-

In this problem, both of the fractions refer to the same whole, namely the total number of students in the fifth grade. However, it is likely that some of the students want to play in both groups, so it is not appropriate to add the two fractions.

-

In this problem, the two fractions refer to the same whole, the number of students in the fifth grade. Since the rating is of their favorite sport, it is probable that each student was only allowed to select one favorite sport so that there is no overlap between the two sets. Thus it is appropriate to add the fractions to find that $\frac{7}{10}$ like one of these two sports best. Note that the total number of students in the fifth grade is given and is not necessary to answer the question. It is useful for students to see some questions where not all of the information is necessary to solve the problem.

-

In this problem, the two fractions are not of the same whole; rather each is a fraction of a different team. Thus it is not appropriate to add the fractions to find the fraction of the two teams that are girls. To answer the question of what fraction of the whole are girls, it would be necessary to know how many people are on each team. One would add together the number of players on the two teams to form the denominator of the new fraction. To find the number of girls on each team, one would multiply the fraction of girls on each times the number of members of the team and add together the total number of girls to get the numerator of the fraction that represents the total.

-

In this problem, both fractions are parts of the same whole, namely one mile, so it is appropriate to add them to find he ran a total of $\frac{7}{10}$ of a mile.

5.NF How Much Pie?

##
Task

After a class potluck, Emily has three equally sized apple pies left and she wants to divide them into eight equal portions to give to eight students who want to take some pie home.

- Draw a picture showing how Emily might divide the pies into eight equal portions. Explain how your picture shows eight equal portions.

- What fraction of a pie will each of the eight students get?

- Explain how the answer to (b) is related the division problem $3 \div 8$.

##
Solution

-

Below is a picture of how Emily might divide the three apple pies into eight equal portions. Here each color (yellow, orange, red, green, blue, dark purple, light purple, and light blue) represents one portion. So each portion consists of three pieces of pie and each piece of pie represents $\frac{1}{8}$ of a full pie:

Because these pies are all the same size and they are all apple pies, Emily does not need to give each student one piece of each of the three pies: two or three pieces of the same pie could go to one student. This picture, however, shows clearly that the pies have been divided into eight equal portions. If multiple pieces of a particular pie were to go to the same student, it would be necessary to analyze the picture more closely and count how many slices of pie each student received to check that it has been divided evenly.

-

As the picture shows, each portion consists of three slices of apple pie. Since these slices represent $\frac{1}{8}$ of a pie, this means that each student gets $\frac{3}{8}$ of an apple pie.

-

If 3 pies are divided into 8 equal portions, then 8 of these portions makes 3 pies, a fact that is clearly illustrated in part (a). We can write this in symbols if we use a question mark to represent the amount of pie in one portion: $$8 \times ? = 3$$ When we know a factor and the product, we can find the other factor by dividing: $$3 \div 8 = ?$$ So one person's portion is whatever we get when we divide 3 by 8. In part (b), we saw that one portion is $\frac38$. So that means that $$3 \div 8 = \frac38.$$

5.NF Connor and Makayla Discuss Multiplication

##
Task

Makayla said, "I can represent $3\times \frac23$ with 3 rectangles each of length $\frac23$."

Connor said, “I know that $\frac23 \times 3$ can be thought of as $\frac23$ of 3. Is 3 copies of $\frac23$ the same as $\frac23$ of 3?”

- Draw a diagram to represent $\frac23$ of 3.

- Explain why your picture and Makayla’s picture together show that $3\times \frac23 = \frac23 \times 3$.

- What property of multiplication do these pictures illustrate?

##
Solution

- A rectangle of length 3 can be built from three rectangles of length 1:

Thus, $\frac23$ of the large rectangle is 2 of the smaller rectangles of length 1.

- We can see in Makayla's picture that there are 3 groups of 2 thirds, so there are 6 thirds all together. Since 3 thirds is 1 whole, 6 thirds is $6\div3 =$ 2 wholes. So three rectangles each of length $\frac23$ has a total length of 2.

In the picture for part (a), we can see that $\frac23$ of 3 is also 2. So this shows that 3 groups of $\frac23$ (an interpretation of $3\times \frac23$) is equal to $\frac23$ of 3 (an interpretation of $\frac23 \times 3$), or $$3\times \frac23 = \frac23 \times 3$$

- These pictures illustrate the commutative property of multiplication.

- How many quarter cups does she need for the milk? Draw a picture to illustrate your solution, and write an equation that represents the situation.

- Carolina does not remember in what order she added the ingredients but the last ingredient added required 12 quarter cups. What was the last ingredient Carolina added to the pudding? Draw a picture to illustrate your solution, and write an equation that represents the situation.

##
Solution

-

Carolina needs 8 quarter cups of sour cream because there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, and so it takes $2\times 4 = 8$ quarter cups to make 2 cups:

This is a "how many groups?" division problem because it asks "How many quarter cups are in 2 cups?" There are two correct equations: $$2\div \frac14 = \text{ ?}$$ or equivalently: $$\text{ ?} \times \frac14 = 2$$ We can verify that 8 is the correct solution by noting that $8 \times \frac14=\frac84=2$ (4.NF.4c).

-

Carolina needs 16 quarter cups of milk because there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, and so $4\times4$ quarter cups in 4 cups, as we see in this picture:

Again, this is a "how many groups?" division problem because it asks "How many quarter cups are in 4 cups?" There are two correct equations: $$4\div \frac14 = \text{ ?}$$ or equivalently, $$\text{ ?} \times \frac14 = 4$$ We can verify that 16 is the correct solution by noting that $16 \times \frac14=\frac{16}{4} = 4$.

-

We can think of this problem several ways. First, we can ask, "How many cups did I start with if I ended up with 12 quarter cups?" We could write an equation for this: $$\text{? }\div \frac14 = 12$$ We could also say, "I have 12 quarter cups and I want to know how many cups this is, so I can multiply 12 and $\frac14$ to find the number of cups I started with." This can be represented by the following equation: $$12 \times \frac14 =\text{ ?}$$ Notice that these two equations are equivalent and can both be interpreted in terms of the following picture:

Here is yet another approach: If we note that there are 4 quarter cups in 1 cup, we can also think of this as a "how many groups?" division problem. We know that there are a total of 12 quarter cups and that there are 4 quarter cups in a cup (a group), and we want to know how many cups (or how many groups) this makes. Here the equation is: $$12\div4 = \text{ ?}$$ Since $12\div4 = 3$, she must have started with the vanilla pudding mix, as that is the only ingredient that requires 3 cups.

5.OA Watch Out for Parentheses 1

##
Task

Evaluate the following numerical expressions.

- $2\times5+3\times2+4$

- $2\times(5+3\times2+4)$

- $2\times5+3\times(2+4)$

- $2\times(5+3)\times2+4$

- $(2\times5)+(3\times2)+4$

- $2\times(5+3)\times(2+4)$

Can the parentheses in any of these expressions be removed without changing the value the expression?

##
Solution

-

We follow the usual order of operations and multiply before adding:

$$2\times5 + 3\times2 + 4= 10+6+4 = 20$$

- Before multiplying the first 2, we complete the operations inside the parentheses using oder of operations: $$2\times(5+3\times2+4)=2\times(5+6+4) = 2\times15=30$$

- We first complete the addition in parentheses and then follow the usual order of operations: $$2\times5+3\times(2+4)= 2\times5 +3\times6 = 10+18 = 28$$

- We first complete the addition in parentheses and then follow the usual order of operations: $$2\times(5+3)\times2+4=2\times 8\times 2 +4 = 32+4 = 36$$

- In this case the placement of parentheses does not change the value of the expression. We can remove them and see that we get the same expression as in part (a): $$(2\times5)+(3\times2)+4=2\times5+3\times2+4 = 20$$

- We first complete the addition in parentheses and then multiply: $$2\times(5+3)\times(2+4)=2\times 8\times6 = 96$$

The five expressions aside from part (e) evaluate to different results. Therefore, we cannot remove any of the parentheses without changing the value of the expression, since doing so would give us one of the other expressions in the list. For example, if we remove the parentheses in (b) we get the expression from (a). The placement of the parentheses forces us to complete the computations in a different order than we would according to the standard order of operations.

5.OA Video Game Scores

##
Task

Eric is playing a video game. At a certain point in the game, he has 31500 points. Then the following events happen, in order:

- He earns 2450 additional points.

- He loses 3310 points.

- The game ends, and his score doubles.

-

Write an expression for the number of points Eric has at the end of the game. Do not evaluate the expression. The expression should keep track of what happens in each step listed above.

-

Eric's sister Leila plays the same game. When she is finished playing, her score is given by the expression $$ 3(24500 + 3610) - 6780. $$ Describe a sequence of events that might have led to Leila earning this score.

##
Solution

-

When Eric earns 2450 additional points, his score becomes 31500 + 2450.

When he loses 3310 points, his score becomes (31500 + 2450) - 3310. (Note that this can also be written without the parentheses.)

When Eric's score doubles, the score becomes 2 x ((31500 + 2450) - 3310), which can also be written 2(31500 + 2450 - 3310).

-

Here is a possible sequence of events that might lead to the score given:

- At a certain point in the game, Leila has 24500 points.

- She earns 3610 additional points.

- Her score triples.

- She loses 6780 points.

Note that the order of the steps is important; rearranging the steps will likely lead to a different expression and a different final score.

5.OA Sidewalk Patterns

##
Task

Cora and Cecilia each use chalk to make their own number patterns on the sidewalk. They make each of their patterns 10 boxes long and line their patterns up so they are next to each other.

Cora puts 0 in her first box and decides that she will add 3 every time to get the next number.

Cecilia puts 0 in her first box and decides that she will add 9 every time to get the next number.

- Complete each girl's sidewalk pattern.

- How many times greater is Cecilia’s number in the 5th box be than Cora’s number in the 5th box? What about the numbers in the 8th box? The 10th box?

- What pattern do you notice in your answers for part b? Why do you think that pattern exists?

- If Cora and Cecilia kept their sidewalk patterns going, what number will be in Cora's box when Cecilia's corresponding box shows 153?

​

##
Solutions

Solution:

Solution: 1

a.

b.

We can see that at the 5th, 8th and 10th boxes, Cecilia's number is always 3 times Cora's number.

Cecilia's number will always be three times Cora's number, no matter which pair of corresponding boxes the girls stand on. Cora's box shows 0 and the multiples of 3. Cecilia's box shows 0 and the multiples of 9.

c.

The image above shows us the 3 as a factor in each of Cora's terms in her path. It also shows the 9 as a factor in each of Cecilia's terms in her path, though 9 is being represented as 3 x 3. This allows us to see that Cora's factor of 3 is contained in each of Cecilia's terms, as well as one extra factor of 3. This is why Cecilia's term will always be three times Cora's corresponding term in her path.

d.

If Cecilia's box shows 153, then Cora's corresponding box must have 51. We know that Cecilia's box will always show three times as much as Cora's corresponding box, so Cora's box must show 51.
