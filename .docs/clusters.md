# K–5 Cluster Types

Clusters are the Common Core groupings of closely related standards inside each domain. 
Every standard belongs to exactly one cluster, and each cluster is tagged as **Major**, **Supporting**, or **Additional** work via the `msa` flag that ships with the data feed.


This reference lists all K–5 clusters by domain and cluster type so you can see how Major work concentrates in each grade.
