## 3. Notes
- Standards for exponents (8.EE) are beyond the documented scope; Montessori “Powers of Numbers” is preparatory only.
- Each chapter file’s front matter includes additional metadata (grade bands, objectives) useful for automated crosswalk generation.
- When building curricula or digital mappings, reference section headings within each file (e.g., “Operations: Addition”) alongside the standards listed above.
