## Overview
Montessori problem solving trains learners to choose among four complementary solution methods—sensorial, modeling, arithmetic, algebraic—depending on context and readiness. Complexity rises from concrete whole-number and measurement problems in lower elementary to fractional, algebraic, proportional, and coordinate challenges in upper elementary.

---

## Solution Methods
1. **Sensorial:** Manipulate Montessori materials (golden beads, fraction circles, measurement tools) to concretize quantities.
2. **Modeling:** Draw pictures, create bar models, tape diagrams, number lines, tables, graphs, or write descriptive statements.
3. **Arithmetic:** Use written computation, estimation, and mental strategies.
4. **Algebraic:** Introduce symbols, equations, inequalities, formulas, and variables.
Each problem strand can be experienced through all four methods, with increasing abstraction over the three series.

## Lower Elementary Focus
### Contexts
- **Whole-Number Operations (Addition/Subtraction)**
- **Measurement (Money, Length)**

### Sensorial & Modeling
- Use Montessori materials or pictures to represent “adding to,” “taking from,” “putting together,” “taking apart,” and “comparing.”
- Solve word problems with unknowns in any position; use chicks/counters, bead bars, or money cards.

### Arithmetic & Algebraic
- Record equations with symbols for unknowns; employ paper-pencil strategies.
- Interpret vocabulary cues to choose addition or subtraction.

### Standards
- 1.OA.A.1–2, 2.OA.A.1, 2.MD.B.5, 2.MD.C.8.

---

## Middle Elementary Focus
### Contexts
- **Whole-Number Multiplication/Division**
- **Fraction Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication (like denominators; fraction × whole)**
- **Measurement (time, mass, volume)**
- **Geometry (perimeter/area of plane figures)**

### Sensorial & Modeling
- Employ fraction circles/models; time number lines; measurement diagrams; area/perimeter manipulatives.

### Arithmetic & Algebraic
- Solve multi-step word problems, interpret remainders, assess reasonableness via estimation/rounding.
- Represent problems with equations containing letters for unknowns; differentiate multiplicative vs additive comparisons.

### Standards
- 3.OA.A.3, 3.OA.D.8, 4.OA.A.2–3, 4.NF.B.3.D, 4.NF.B.4.C, 3.MD.A.1–2, 3.MD.D.8, 4.MD.A.2–3.

---

## Upper Elementary Focus
### Contexts
- **Fraction operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)**
- **Ratios, rates, percentages**
- **Measurement (volume, surface area, area/perimeter of complex figures)**
- **Algebraic equations/inequalities**
- **Coordinate systems (1st quadrant and full plane)**

### Sensorial & Modeling
- Use fraction models, nets, tape diagrams, double number lines, coordinate grids.
- Visualize inequation solution sets, dependent/independent relationships via graphs/tables.

### Arithmetic & Algebraic
- Apply benchmark fractions for estimation; solve equations/inequalities; analyze rate/ratio problems; compute volume using formulas; graph coordinate points in all quadrants.

### Standards
- 5.NF.A.2, 5.NF.B.6, 5.NF.B.7.C, 5.G.A.2, 5.MD.C.5.
- 6.EE.B.7–8, 6.EE.C.9, 6.RP.A.3 (including unit rates and percent), 6.NS.C.8, 6.G.A.1–2, 6.G.A.4.

## Implementation Notes
- Sequence problems from concrete to abstract across the four methods.
- Maintain categorized problem card libraries (by context, method, and standard) to facilitate future digital mapping.
- Link each problem context to ATC knowledge-graph nodes (e.g., `problem-solv-addition`, `fraction-word-problem`, `ratio-table-modeling`, `volume-formula`) with metadata for solution methods available.
- Encourage learners to articulate method choice and reasoning, reinforcing metacognition about problem-solving strategies.
