## Overview
Chapter 10 spans two strands:
1. **Data & Graphs** — collecting, representing, and analyzing data via Montessori-based activities progressing from simple picture/bar graphs to statistical summaries.
2. **Measurement** — building measurement understanding from concrete length/time/money tasks to multi-step conversions and real-world applications.

## Data & Graphs Sequence
### Lower Elementary
- **Data Collection Activities:** Teacher-created experiments gathering categorical or measurement data.
- **Picture & Bar Graphs:** Construct single-unit picture/bar graphs; answer “how many more/less” questions.
- **Line Plots:** Represent repeated measurements with whole-number scales.
- **Learning Goals:** Organize basic data sets; interpret totals, categories, and differences.

### Middle Elementary
- **Scaled Picture/Bar Graphs:** Use scaled symbols/intervals; solve two-step comparison problems.
- **Line Plots with Fractions:** Measure lengths in halves/quarters; display fractional data; solve fraction addition/subtraction problems.
- **Pie Graphs:** Create simple scaled circle graphs for categorical data.

### Upper Elementary
- **Statistical Questions & Distributions:** Distinguish statistical questions; describe data using center/spread/shape.
- **Graph Types:** Construct and interpret line graphs, dot plots, histograms, box plots.
- **Summary Measures:** Calculate mean, median, interquartile range, mean absolute deviation; explain context-based conclusions.

## Measurement Sequence
### Lower Elementary
- **History & Concept Lessons:** Appreciate need for standard units; understand measurement as repeated units.
- **Length Tools:** Use rulers, yardsticks, meter sticks, tapes; estimate lengths in various units; measure differences.
- **Number Line Applications:** Map measurements onto number lines; add/subtract lengths.
- **Money Work:** Identify coins, count combinations, solve money word problems.
- **Time Lessons:** Tell time to nearest five minutes (analog/digital); use AM/PM; represent time intervals on number lines.

### Middle Elementary
- **Metric System Introduction:** Understand metric/customary units; compare unit sizes.
- **Volume & Mass:** Measure with liters, grams, kilograms; solve one-step volume/mass problems.
- **Time & Temperature:** Use number lines, diagrams for elapsed time; read thermometers; convert within units.
- **Conversion Tables:** Record equivalents (e.g., feet/inches); solve word problems using conversions.

### Upper Elementary
- **Advanced Conversions:** Convert between units within a system; apply conversions in multi-step contexts (5.MD.A.1).
- **Problem Solving:** Combine measurement skills (length, time, money, mass, volume, temperature) with algebraic reasoning in real-world scenarios.

## Implementation Notes
- Catalog lesson IDs for data collection, graph types, and measurement tasks to align with digital activity mapping.
- Map each mini-lesson to knowledge-graph nodes (e.g., `line-plot-fractions`, `measurement-conversion`, `statistical-variability`).
- Retain vocabulary lists for assessment creation and progress tracking.
- Encourage cross-strand integration: e.g., use measurement data as inputs for graphing/statistical analysis to reinforce interconnected learning.
