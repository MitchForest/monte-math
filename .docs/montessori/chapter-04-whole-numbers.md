## Overview
Whole-number operations in Montessori elementary progress from sensorial experiences (golden beads, bead bars, strip boards) to abstract algorithms. The strand spans addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, properties of numbers, memorization of facts, and analysis of multiples, factors, and divisibility. Lower elementary learners rely heavily on concrete materials while upper elementary students internalize algorithms and work abstractly.

## Operations: Addition
### Core Lessons (Initial Series)
- **Golden Beads (Static & Dynamic Addition):** Model place-value alignment and composition of tens/hundreds as quantities are combined.
- **Bead Bars & Multiple Addends:** Reinforce aggregation, counting-on, and the link between addition and repeated addition.
- **Stamp Game:** Transition from concrete to symbolic addition while practicing carrying.
- **Dot Game:** Emphasizes column addition and regrouping within a more abstract format.
- **Hierarchical Frames:** Provide symbolic practice with carrying and recording.
- **Unknown Number Activities:** Solve equations with unknowns in any position.

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain consistent lesson identifiers when cataloguing teacher-created cards/activities for digital integration.
- Vocabulary lists by series can seed assessment rubrics and data capture.
- When mapping to ATC knowledge graph, link each lesson set to relevant node IDs (e.g., `addition-with-regrouping`, `long-division-algorithm`, `multiples-and-factors`).
- Consider tagging lessons with Montessori material identifiers and CCSS practice codes to support adaptive task selection.
