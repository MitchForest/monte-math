## Overview
Montessori fraction work begins with sensorial impressions of parts of a whole, then extends to symbolic representation, operations, and abstract reasoning. Students progress from manipulating fraction circles and equivalent figure materials to solving mixed-number operations and real-world problems using benchmark fractions and number sense.

---

## Foundations
### Initial Series Lessons
- **Introduction to Fractions:** Impressionistic stories and notation, using fraction circles to experience halves, thirds, fourths, etc.
- **Common Fractions (Quantities & Symbols):** Associate fraction names with concrete pieces and notation.
- **Fractions as Part of a Set:** Apply fractional language to collections of discrete objects.
- **Equivalent Figure Material (Metal Squares/Triangles):** Partition rectangles into equal shares, reinforce that equal shares can have different shapes and sizes.

### Purposes & Outcomes
- Partition circles/rectangles into equal shares; describe using words and “__ of __” phrasing.
- Recognize the whole as the sum of fractional parts (e.g., four fourths make a whole).
- Relate fractions to parts of a set as well as subdivided shapes.
- Prepare for number-line representation and comparison.

### Middle Series Extensions
- **Common Fractions:** Address mixed numbers and fractions greater than one.
- **Number Lines:** Place fraction circles along number lines; mark equal partitions between whole numbers.
- **Comparing Lessons:** Use concrete proofs to compare fractions (same numerator/denominator, then different ones) and understand requirement of same whole.

### Standards Alignment (Foundations)
- 1.G.A.3, 2.G.A.2, 2.G.A.3 — partitioning shapes and describing shares.
- 3.G.A.2 — express area parts as unit fractions.
- 3.NF.A.1–A.3 — fraction as number, number line placement, comparison.
- 4.NF.A.2 — comparisons with unlike numerators/denominators.

---

## Equivalence
### Lessons
- **Fraction Circles:** Visualize equivalent slices (e.g., 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6).
- **Equivalent Figure Material:** Show same-area decompositions with varying shapes.
- **Paper Number Lines/Transparencies:** Map equivalent fractions to identical points on a number line; express tenths as hundredths.

### Outcomes
- Recognize two fractions as equivalent when they represent the same area or number-line point.
- Explain why fractions are equivalent using visual fraction models.
- Generate equivalent forms, including expressing whole numbers as fractions and translating denominator 10 to 100.

### Standards Alignment (Equivalence)
- 1.G.A.3, 2.G.A.3 — decomposition into smaller equal shares.
- 3.G.A.2, 3.NF.A.3 — equivalence reasoning via size and number line.
- 4.NF.A.1 — justify equivalence using scaling argument.
- 4.NF.C.5 — convert 10ths to 100ths.

## Addition & Subtraction
### Initial Series
- **Fraction Circles — Same Denominators:** Concrete addition/subtraction of like fractions.

### Middle Series
- **Beyond Simple Cases:** Sensorial work finding common denominators.
- **Mixed Numbers:** Add/subtract with like denominators via equivalent fractions and operational properties.
- **Transparencies & Alternate Methods:** Visualize decomposition and reconstruction.
- **Problem-Solving Cards:** Word problems with visual models.

### Later Series
- **Graph-Paper/Passage to Abstraction:** Compute with unlike denominators, find LCD, use benchmark fractions for estimation.
- **Advanced Word Problems:** Multi-step contexts, reasonableness checks.

### Standards Alignment (Add/Subtract)
- 4.NF.B.3 — compose/decompose, mixed numbers, word problems.
- 4.NF.C.5 — add tenths and hundredths.
- 5.NF.A.1–A.2 — unlike denominators, estimation.

---

## Multiplication
### Lessons
- **Initial Series:** Simple cases and fraction×whole-number with fraction circles.
- **Middle Series:** Sensorial multiplication by whole numbers; word problems.
- **Later Series:** Fraction×fraction, graphical methods, movement to abstract algorithms; interpret scaling (greater/less than one); real-world contexts.

### Standards Alignment (Multiplication)
- 4.NF.B.4 — fraction × whole number.
- 5.NF.B.4 — fraction × fraction, area interpretation.
- 5.NF.B.5 — scaling explanations.
- 5.NF.B.6 — real-world word problems.

---

## Division
### Lessons
- **Initial Series:** Fraction ÷ whole number via sensorial sharing.
- **Middle Series:** Extend to partitive division and fraction ÷ fraction using fraction circles; highlight quotient meanings.
- **Later Series:** Abstract algorithms, real-world problem solving requiring fractional quotients.

### Standards Alignment (Division)
- 5.NF.B.3 — interpret fraction as division, word problems.
- 5.NF.B.4.A — connect product interpretations to division sequence.
- 5.NF.B.7 — unit fraction division relationships.
- 6.NS.A.1 — divide fractions by fractions in real-world contexts.

---

## Vocabulary & Observation Notes
- **Vocabulary:** Differentiated by series, covering language of shapes, partitions, numerators/denominators, equivalence, operations, and estimation.
- **Observations:** Focus on sensorial understanding before abstraction, ensuring students refer to a common whole when comparing fractions.

---

## Implementation Considerations
- Maintain consistent naming for teacher-created lessons (number lines, transparencies, problem cards) to map into digital resources.
- When linking to ATC knowledge graph, align each lesson set with nodes such as `fraction-partitioning`, `fraction-equivalence`, `fraction-addition-unlike-denominators`, etc.
- Tag lessons with relevant CCSS codes and Montessori material identifiers to support adaptive task selection and standards reporting.
