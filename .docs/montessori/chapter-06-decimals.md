## Overview
Decimal study extends Montessori place-value work into fractional parts of ten. Learners encounter tenths through millionths using the decimal board, connect decimals to fractional notation, position decimals on number lines, compare/round values, and eventually perform all four operations with standard algorithms.

## Foundations
### Middle Series Lessons
| Lesson | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Decimal Board — Introduction to Decimal Fractions** | Familiarize students with place-value categories from tenths to millionths; introduce language for decimal places. |
| **Decimal Board — Symbolic Notation** | Write decimals corresponding to bead quantities; connect decimal-point notation to fractional meaning. |
| **Conversion Between Common Fractions and Decimals** | Practice expressing decimals as fractions (denominators 10, 100) and vice versa. |
| **Teacher-Created Number-Line Lessons** | Locate decimals on number lines; define intervals between whole numbers as a “whole” comprised of ten or one hundred equal parts. |
| **Comparing Decimals (to hundredths)** | Reason about decimal size, justify comparisons with models, and record results using >, =, <. |

### Later Series Extensions
| Lesson | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Decimal Board — Multi-digit Formation & Reading** | Read/write decimals (base-ten numerals, number names, expanded form) through thousandths and beyond. |
| **Comparison Lessons (to thousandths)** | Use place-value reasoning to compare decimals; emphasize 10×/1/10 relationships between adjacent places. |
| **Rounding Lessons** | Round decimals to any place, understanding rounding up/down mechanics using models. |

### Outcomes & Standards Alignment
- Use decimal notation for tenths/hundredths; convert decimals ↔ fractions (4.NF.C.6).
- Place decimals on number lines, compare to hundredths (4.NF.C.7).
- Recognize place-value scaling (5.NBT.A.1) and read/write decimals to thousandths in multiple representations (5.NBT.A.3).
- Compare decimals to thousandths and round using place-value understanding (5.NBT.A.3, 5.NBT.A.4).

## Operations
### Middle Series Focus
- **Decimal Board Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication by unit multipliers, multi-digit multiplication, and division by unit divisors provide sensorial grounding for decimal arithmetic.
- **Decimal Checkerboard:** Visualizes decimal multiplication (whole × decimal, decimal × decimal) and partial products.
- **Skittles (Division with Decimals):** Extends bead-material division to decimal dividends.

### Later Series Progression
- **Decimal Checkerboard with Felt Squares:** Explore powers of ten; observe zero patterns and decimal-point movement when scaling by 10ⁿ.
- **Paper-Based Algorithms:** Transition from materials to written methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; emphasize reasoning behind decimal-point placement.
- **Problem Contexts:** Apply operations to real-world scenarios, justify strategies, and verify reasonableness.

### Expected Competencies & Standards Alignment
- Explain zero/decimal-point patterns for powers of ten (5.NBT.A.2).
- Perform decimal operations to hundredths using concrete models, place-value reasoning, and properties (5.NBT.B.7).
- Relate hands-on strategies to written algorithms and achieve fluency across all operations (6.NS.B.3).

## Implementation Notes
- Track teacher-created conversion, number-line, comparison, and rounding lessons with consistent identifiers for mapping to digital resources.
- When linking to the knowledge graph, map lessons to nodes such as `decimal-place-value`, `decimal-number-line`, `decimal-addition`, `decimal-division-powers-of-ten`. Tag each lesson with relevant CCSS codes and Montessori materials to support adaptive assignment and reporting.
