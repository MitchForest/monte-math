## Overview
Chapter 7 organizes Montessori algebra into three intertwined pathways:
1. **Powers of Numbers** — sensorial introduction to squares, cubes, and roots leading toward algebraic formulas.
2. **Signed Numbers** — concrete exploration of integers and absolute value, supporting rational-number reasoning.
3. **Introductory Algebra** — manipulation of expressions, equations, and inequalities with variables in real-world contexts.

## Skill Cluster: Powers of Numbers
### Lower Elementary Foundations
- **Bead Cabinet Explorations:** Build square and cube chains/polygons; observe geometric-arithmetic connection for numbers 1–10.
- **Tower of Jewels:** Visual representation of cubes increasing in size.
- **Concept & Notation Lessons:** Link terminology (“square,” “cube”) to symbolic notation (e.g., 5², 3³).

### Upper Elementary Extensions
| Lesson | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Paper Decanomial & Golden Beads — Squaring** | Model binomial/trinomial squares; connect geometric patterns to algebraic forms. |
| **Transformation of Squares** | Transition from concrete shapes to symbolic binomial-square formulas. |
| **Exponential Notation** | Explore multiplication/division of powers with same base. |
| **Algebraic Passages (Binomial/Trinomial Squares)** | Derive formulas, practice substitution. |
| **Cubing Materials (Binomial/Trinomial Cubes)** | Visualize cube expansion patterns, paving the way for algebraic identities. |
| **Hierarchical Trinomial Cube** | Extend cubing to decimal representations; connect to place-value systems. |
| **Square Root Sequence (Beads → Board → Pegboard → Paper)** | Extract square roots from sensorial models to abstract algorithms. |
| **Cube Root Sequence** | Progress from concrete cubes to abstract computation for 4–9 digit numbers. |

> **Note:** Although CCSS exponents standards begin in Grade 8, these lessons scaffold conceptual understanding for future formal exponents and radicals work.

## Skill Cluster: Signed Numbers
### Lessons & Purposes
- **Negative Snake Game (Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division):** Sensorial experience that positive and negative quantities cancel or reinforce each other.
- **Number Line & Coordinate Plane Activities:** Position integers/rational numbers, interpret inequalities, and understand opposites.
- **Absolute Value Lessons:** Conceptualize distance from zero and distinguish absolute value from order statements.
- **Paper-Based Computation:** Transition to abstract operations; evaluate signed-number expressions and word problems.
- **Problem-Solving Cards:** Apply integer reasoning to temperatures, elevation changes, gains/losses, etc.

### Expected Outcomes & Standards
- Use signed numbers to describe opposite quantities (6.NS.C.5).
- Locate integers/rationals on horizontal/vertical number lines and coordinate planes (6.NS.C.6.A, 6.NS.C.6.C).
- Interpret inequalities via position; understand absolute value as distance/magnitude (6.NS.C.7A–D).
- Contextualize zero and opposite numbers in real-world scenarios.

### Lesson Flow
| Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|----------------|
| **Expressions & Grouping** | Bead-bar activities with parentheses/brackets/braces; write and interpret numeric expressions (5.OA.A.1–2). |
| **Exponents & Order of Operations** | Introduce whole-number exponents; apply PEMDAS using manipulatives and written practice (6.EE.A.1–2). |
| **Equivalent Expressions** | Use distributive and associative properties to simplify; identify equivalent expressions (6.EE.A.3–4). |
| **Balance & Solving for Unknowns** | Balance-scale metaphors, inverse operations for one-variable equations; extend to equations with two unknowns. |
| **Inequalities & Solutions Sets** | Represent inequalities on number lines; interpret infinite solution sets (6.EE.B.8). |
| **Dependent/Independent Variables & Graphs** | Translate verbal relationships to tables, graphs, and equations (6.EE.C.9). |
| **Problem Translation & Word Problems** | Convert real-life descriptions into algebraic expressions/equations; use substitution to test solutions (6.EE.B.5–7). |

### Outcomes & Standards Alignment
- Evaluate numeric and algebraic expressions with grouping symbols and exponents (5.OA.A.1–2, 6.EE.A.1–2).
- Apply properties to generate equivalent expressions and recognize equivalence (6.EE.A.3–4).
- Solve equations/inequalities using substitution and inverse operations (6.EE.B.5–8).
- Model dependent/independent variable relationships with tables, graphs, and equations (6.EE.C.9).

## Implementation Notes
- Track Montessori materials (e.g., binomial cube, negative snake game) and teacher-created resources to enable mapping to digital activities.
- When integrating with the ATC knowledge graph, map lessons to nodes such as `integer-operations`, `binomial-square`, `solve-one-variable-equation`, or `dependent-variable-graphs` and tag associated CCSS codes.
- Although powers-of-numbers lessons lack direct CCSS references, cataloging them with metadata ensures they can support future exponents standards and enrichment pathways.
