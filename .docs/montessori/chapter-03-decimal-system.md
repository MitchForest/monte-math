## Overview
Chapter 3 outlines the Montessori decimal system strand. Early lessons (Initial Series) ground children in concrete quantities 0–10, counting beyond 10, and the bead cabinet chains. Subsequent work extends to odd/even analysis, expanded form, and mental adjustments within the base-ten system. Place-value studies deepen understanding of hierarchical categories (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.), comparisons, rounding, and powers of ten for both lower and upper elementary learners.

## Skill Cluster: Number and Quantity (Lower Elementary)
### Montessori Lessons & Purposes
| Lesson Set | Key Materials | Purposes |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Numbers 1–10** | Cards and Counters; Colored Bead Bars (Bead Stair; Snake Game—In Search of 10); Memory Games of Numbers | Reinforce that each number is composed of discrete quantities; verify number sequence 1–10; match quantities to symbols; build memory of numeric symbols; generalize number knowledge to daily life objects. |
| **Counting & Numbers >10** | Golden Beads (introduction to quantity, games, change/exchange); Number Cards; Seguin Boards (Teens & Tens) | Introduce category names (unit, ten, hundred, thousand); show relationships between categories; provide sensorial impression of bulk differences (e.g., 6 units vs 6 hundreds); reinforce language and symbols for multiples; associate concrete and symbolic representations; read/write numbers to 1,000; use zero as placeholder; count forward from any number; link 11–19 to ten plus ones; understand tens progression. |
| **Bead Cabinet & Chains** | Bead Cabinet (100 & 1000 chains, number pyramid) | Consolidate linear and skip counting; visualize squares/cubes via chains; emphasize 100 as 10 tens, 1,000 as 10 hundreds; motivate repeated counting; read/write numerals up to 1,000. |
| **Odd & Even** | Cards and Counters; Hundred Board | Determine parity by grouping/pairing; express even numbers as sums of equal addends; connect parity to equation writing. |
| **Expanded Form / 10 More or Less** | Teacher-created cards, charts, number lines | Decompose numbers into place-value components; write expanded form; mentally compute 10 more/less without counting by ones. |

### Expected Competencies (Initial Series)
- Count to 120 from any starting point; read/write numerals up to 120 (1.NBT.A.1).
- Mentally add or subtract 10 from a two-digit number and explain reasoning (1.NBT.C.5).
- Count within 1,000 by 1s, 5s, 10s, 100s (2.NBT.A.2).
- Read/write numbers to 1,000 in numerals, words, and expanded form (2.NBT.A.3).
- Determine odd/even status via pairing; express even numbers as sums of equal addends (2.OA.C.3).

## Skill Cluster: Place Value (Lower & Upper Elementary)
### Montessori Lessons & Purposes
| Lesson Set | Key Materials | Purposes |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Decimal Categories & Numeration** | Golden Beads and Cards (association games, formation of numbers, tray of nine); Wooden Hierarchical Material | Introduce and extend decimal families (units, tens, hundreds, thousands+); associate symbol-name-quantity; concept of bundling ten ones into a ten, ten tens into a hundred; sensorial experience of hierarchical bulk beyond thousands. |
| **Hierarchical Frames & Bead Frames** | Hierarchical Frames; Bead Frame | Read large numbers; compose/decompose using bead frame; integrate zero as placeholder; write multi-digit numbers. |
| **Comparison Lessons** | Teacher-created cards/number lines | Compare numbers using <, =, >; leverage place-value meanings to justify comparisons. |
| **Expanded Form & Notation** | Teacher-created expanded-form strips/cards | Represent numbers in base-ten numerals, number names, expanded form. |
| **Rounding & Powers of Ten (Middle Series)** | Stamp Game; Number Line; teacher-designed rounding charts | Mentally determine 10 more/less; round numbers to nearest 10/100; round multi-digit numbers to any place. |
| **Ten Times More / One-Tenth Less (Later Series)** | Teacher-created multiplicative place-value tasks | Recognize multiplicative relationships between adjacent places (×10, ÷10); articulate tenfold increase/decrease across digits. |

### Expected Competencies
- **Initial Series:**
  - Understand tens/ones composition (1.NBT.B.2 A–C); compare two-digit numbers via place value (1.NBT.B.3).
  - Recognize hundreds, tens, ones (2.NBT.A.1 A–B); read/write numbers to 1,000; compare three-digit numbers using <, =, > (2.NBT.A.4).
- **Middle Series:**
  - Round to nearest 10/100 (3.NBT.A.1); recognize digit relationships (4.NBT.A.1).
  - Read/write multi-digit numbers in all representations; compare using place-value reasoning (4.NBT.A.2); round to any place (4.NBT.A.3).
- **Later Series:**
  - Identify ×10 and ×1/10 relationships between adjacent places (5.NBT.A.1).

## Notes for Future Mapping
- Each lesson set can be mapped to ATC knowledge-graph nodes covering counting, base-ten concepts, parity, expanded form, rounding, and place-value relationships.
- Vocabulary lists for Initial/Middle/Later series can seed assessment rubrics and question banks.
- Teacher-created lessons (expanded form, comparison, 10-more/less, ten-times-more) should be catalogued with consistent identifiers so we can tie them to reusable digital activities.
