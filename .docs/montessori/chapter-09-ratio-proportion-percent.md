## Overview
Upper elementary learners explore ratios, proportions, and percentages as interconnected representations of comparative relationships. Montessori materials—fraction insets, centesimal frames, tape diagrams—enable a concrete-to-abstract journey culminating in rate/percent problem solving and measurement conversions.

---

## Ratio Development
### Lessons
- **Concept, Language, Notation:** Introduce ratio vocabulary (“for every…”, “to”).
- **Ratio as Fraction/Division:** Demonstrate that ratios can be expressed as fractions or quotients.
- **Equal Ratios:** Build tables of equivalent ratios; plot pairs on coordinate grids; compare ratios using tables.

### Outcomes
- Describe ratio relationships using precise language (6.RP.A.1).
- Interpret unit rate a/b for ratio a:b; apply rate language (6.RP.A.2).
- Construct tables, complete missing entries, and graph ratio pairs; use tables for comparisons (6.RP.A.3.A).

---

## Proportion Reasoning
### Lessons
- **Concept & Notation of Proportion:** Highlight equality of ratios through manipulatives and visual models.
- **Cross Multiplication:** Transition from concrete comparisons to symbolic verification and solving proportion equations.
- **Problem Solving Cards:** Apply ratios to unit pricing, constant speed, recipe scaling, etc.

### Outcomes
- Use ratio and rate reasoning in real-world contexts (6.RP.A.3).
- Solve unit rate problems; interpret results within contexts (6.RP.A.3.B).

---

## Percent Understanding
### Lessons
- **Centesimal Frame:** Experience hundredths grid; relate fractions to percentages.
- **Conversion Activities:** Convert fraction insets to percentages; move between fraction, decimal, percent forms.
- **Percent Applications:** Solve “part-whole-percent” problems; use double number lines/tables for measurement conversions.

### Outcomes
- Interpret percent as rate per 100 and solve “find part/whole/percent” problems (6.RP.A.3.C).
- Use ratio reasoning for measurement unit conversions; manipulate units appropriately (6.RP.A.3.D).

## Implementation Notes
- Link ratio lessons to knowledge-graph nodes (`ratio-language`, `equivalent-ratios`, `unit-rate`, `percent-conversion`).
- Maintain problem banks tagged by solution method (modeling, arithmetic, algebraic) for adaptive assignment.
- Encourage learners to articulate connections among ratios, fractions, decimals, and percents to reinforce conceptual coherence.
