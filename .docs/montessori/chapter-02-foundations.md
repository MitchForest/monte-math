## Overview
The first Montessori Great Lesson for mathematics, the **Story of Numbers**, situates numeration within a sweeping human narrative. Lower elementary children listen to an oral story describing how humans developed numerals to meet practical needs, sparking curiosity about historical innovations and setting a foundation for later mathematical study.

## Lesson Structure
- **Great Story Presentation:** Guide tells the Story of Numbers to the whole class, emphasizing pivotal moments in numerical history and unnamed contributors who refined the numeral system.
- **Follow-up Inquiry:** Children are encouraged to pose questions about the people, cultures, and needs that shaped numerical development.
- **Research Invitations:** Learners select related topics (e.g., ancient counting systems, invention of zero) to explore through books, timelines, or simple reports.

## Learning Purposes
1. Inspire historical questioning about individuals and groups affecting numerical change.
2. Motivate learners to seek clarification and deeper understanding after oral presentations.
3. Convey that numerals emerged to satisfy human needs, anchoring mathematics in lived experience.
4. Cultivate appreciation for the unnamed innovators behind modern numeration.

## Expected Behaviors (Lower Elementary)
- Listen attentively to the oral story and identify key ideas.
- Ask clarifying or extending questions about unfamiliar details.
- Recount portions of the story or describe significant changes in numeration.
- Gather supplementary information (books, images, short texts) to answer self-generated questions.

## Assessment Notes
- Great Stories are not formally assessed; observation focuses on engagement, questioning, and follow-up initiative.
- Vocabulary emphasis: *ask, answer, detail, describe, information, media, present, question, recount, speaker, text*.

## Standards Connections
| Framework | Code | Application |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| C3 History | His.3.K-2 / His.3.3-5 | Generate questions about historical change-makers in numeration. |
| CCSS ELA SL | SL.1.2, SL.1.3, SL.2.2, SL.2.3 | Ask/answer questions, recount key ideas, clarify understanding after oral presentations. |

## Notes & Follow-up Ideas
- Provide cultural artifacts (number charts, ancient numeral replicas) for tactile exploration.
- Invite learners to create simple timelines showing the evolution from early tally marks to modern digits.
- Encourage journal reflections on how numbers help people solve real-life problems.
